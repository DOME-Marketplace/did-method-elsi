<section id="abstract" class="introductory"><h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>Once an organisation has onboarded an ecosystem like a Data Space, some of its employees have to be appointed to enable them to perform a concrete set of activities in the ecosystem. These activities are performed in the web portals of different organisations which are already participants in the ecosystem, like the onboarding service, the marketplace portals and also in the web portals of other participants.
    </p>
    <p>This document describes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How an organisation can issue Verifiable Credentials to its employees enabling them to perform some specific processes in other organisations "on-behalf-of" the employer, in a way which is compatible with eIDAS and so it provides a legal certainty and non-repudiation levels equivalent to signed documents typically used for those tasks.
        </li>
        <li>How other organisations can accept those Verifiable Credentials to perform authentication and access control, leveraging the eIDAS legal framework to obtain the same levels of legal certainty and non-repudiation as when using other traditional forms of documentation.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <p>Once an organisation has onboarded an ecosystem like a Data Space, some of its employees have to be appointed to enable them to perform a concrete set of activities in the ecosystem. These activities are performed in the web portals of different organisations which are already participants in the ecosystem, like the onboarding service, the marketplace portals and also in the web portals of other participants.
        </p>
        <p>This document describes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How an organisation can issue Verifiable Credentials to its employees enabling them to perform some specific processes in other organisations "on-behalf-of" the employer, in a way which is compatible with eIDAS and so it provides a legal certainty and non-repudiation levels equivalent to signed documents typically used for those tasks.
            </li>
            <li>How other organisations can accept those Verifiable Credentials to perform authentication and access control, leveraging the eIDAS legal framework to obtain the same levels of legal certainty and non-repudiation as when using other traditional forms of documentation.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The mechanisms described here can also be used when the users involved are not strictly employees, but it also works for contractors. It also can be used for customers of the organisation, except the issuance process is probably a little bit different and the roles and duties embedded in the credentials have different legal implications (but always in line with the legal framework, for example with the Consumer Protection Directive).
        </p>
        <p>For clarity of the exposition, we focus in this document on the employee use case, and later we generalise to other types of end-users, including machines and devices acting on behalf of an organisation.
        </p>
        <p>At a high level, we want to enable the use of Verifiable Credentials so that when an entity (a legal person or a natural person acting on behalf of a legal person) wants to perform an action on a protected resource managed by a Relying Party, we use Verifiable Credentials to perform authentication of the entity and then access control based on the content of the Verifiable Credential(s) presented by that entity, and possibly additional authorisation information that the Relying Party considers relevant for controlling access to the protected resource (for example, the contractual status of the resource, time of the day or other context information).
        </p>
        <section id="authentication-requires-a-verifiableid"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-1-1-authentication-requires-a-verifiableid"><bdi class="secno">2.1.1 </bdi>Authentication requires a VerifiableID</h4><a class="self-link" href="#authentication-requires-a-verifiableid" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.1.1"></a></div>

            <p>Not all types of Verifiable Credentials can be used as a mechanism for online authentication, because the Relying Party (the entity receiving the Verifiable Credential in an authentication process) needs to bind the identity of the user sending the credential to the claims attested about the subject inside the credential.
            </p>
            <p>For the purpose of this discussion we use a diagram derived from the taxonomy <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/Data+Models+and+Schemas">defined in EBSI</a>:
            </p>
            <figure id="fig-a-credential-as-a-verifiableid"><img src="builtassets/diagram_98d1805f8f589fef02ad51bb1f5aee60.png" alt="" />

            <p>For example, in the case of a Diploma as a Verifiable Credential (a Verifiable Diploma), the credential is a Verifiable Attestation which indicates that the subject has certain skills or has achieved certain learning outcomes through formal or non-formal learning context. However, as in the case with normal Diplomas in paper of PDF format, this credential can be presented by anyone that holds the credential. In other words, the credential binds the identity of the subject with the claims inside the credential, but does not bind the identity of the holder of the credential with the identity of the subject of the credential, which requires a special mechanism in the issuance process.
            </p>
            <p>Most Verifiable Credentials will be issued as Verifiable Attestations, acting as efficient machine-processable and verifiable equivalent to their analog counterparts. Their purpose is to attest some attributes about the subject of the credential and not act as a mechanism for online authentication.
            </p>
            <p>Instead, <b>a <code>VerifiableID</code> is a special form of a Verifiable Credential that a natural or legal person can use in an electronic identification process as evidence of whom he/she/it is</b> (comparable with a passport, physical IDcard, driving licence, social security card, member-card…).
            </p>
            <p>VerifiableIDs can be of different types and be issued by different entities with different levels of assurance (in eIDAS terminology). They are issued with the purpose of serving as authentication mechanisms in online processes. In the near future, VerifiableIDs of the highest level of assurance (LoA High) will be issued to citizens and businesses by their governments under eIDAS2.
            </p>
            <p>We describe in this document a way to issue VerifiableID credentials and how a Relying Party can perform authentication by accepting that credential.

            <p>In general, in an authentication and access control process, the entity willing to perform an action on a protected resource has to present (in a Verifiable Presentation) a VerifiableID and possibly one or more additional Verifiable Attestations.
            </p>
            <p>The credential should include identifying the employee (or any other subject) and a formal description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation.

            <p>In many use cases, it is possible to simplify the authentication and access control by combining in a single credential both a VerifiableID (authentication) and a Verifiable Authorisation (for access control).
            </p>
            <p>The resulting credential is called LEARCredential and it is very useful when the holder/subject wants to use decentralised IAM mechanisms implemented by Relying Parties which are federated in a decentralised way using a common Trust Anchor Framework.
            </p>
            <p>The concept of LEARCredential is described in the following diagram:
            </p>
            <figure id="fig-the-learcredential-is-both-a-verifiable-authorisation-and-a-verifiableid"><img src="builtassets/diagram_1db8de6de7589d1d42282ac585980fd8.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption><a class="self-link" href="#fig-the-learcredential-is-both-a-verifiable-authorisation-and-a-verifiableid">Figure <bdi class="figno">3</bdi></a> <span class="fig-title">The LEARCredential is both a Verifiable Authorisation and a VerifiableID</span></figcaption></figure>

            <p>The appointed employee will perform the process by using a special type of Verifiable Credential called <code>LEARCredential</code> (from <b>L</b>egal <b>E</b>ntity <b>A</b>ppointed <b>R</b>epresentative).
            </p>
            <p>To achieve a high level of legal certainty under eIDAS, the LEARCredential is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>signed or sealed with an eIDAS certificate which is either:
                    <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a <b>certificate for electronic seals</b> issued to a legal person by a Qualified Trust Service Provider, or
                        </li>
                        <li>a <b>certificate for electronic signatures</b>, issued to a <b>legal representative of the legal person</b> by a Qualified Trust Service Provider.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>signed using the <b>JSON Advanced Electronic Signature</b> format described in <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[ETSI-JADES]]]" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119100_119199/11918201/01.01.01_60/ts_11918201v010101p.pdf">ETSI TS 119 182-1 V1.1.1 (2021-03) - Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); JAdES digital signatures; Part 1: Building blocks and JAdES baseline signatures</a></cite>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The LEARCredential includes claims identifying the employee and a description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation.
            </p>
            <p>By signing/sealing the credential with an eIDAS certificate, the legal representative attests that the powers described in the credential have been delegated to the employee (maybe under some conditions, also described in the credential).
            </p>
            <p>In this way, the LEARCredential has the same legal status as any other document in other formats (e.g., PDF) signed in an eIDAS-compliant way, but with all the advantages provided by the Verifiable Credential format.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, the LEARCredential includes cryptographic material that allows the appointed employee to <b>use the credential as an online authentication mechanism</b> in a portal, by proving that the holder of the credential is the same person identified in the credential.
            </p>
            <p>Any Verifier that trusts the eIDAS Trust Framework will be able to verify that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The person presenting the LEARCredential is the same as the one identified in the credential</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>A legal representative of the organisation has attested that the person has the powers described in the credential</b>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This enables the person presenting the LEARCredential to start the process and to provide any additional required documentation, preferably as additional Verifiable Credentials to enable automatic verification of compliance with the process requirements (including Gaia-X credentials issued by the Compliance Service of Gaia-X).
            </p>
            <p>Both types of eIDAS certificates mentioned above are an electronic attestation <b>that links electronic seal/signature validation data to a legal person and confirms the name of that person</b>. This way, the certificate, usually linked to the sealed/signed document, can be used to verify the identity of the creator of the seal/signature and whether the document has been sealed/signed using the corresponding private key.
            </p>
            <p>Before issuing a certificate like the above, the Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) performs validations against <code>Authentic Sources</code> to authenticate the identity of the organisation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The data concerning the business name or corporate name of the organisation.
                </li>
                <li>The data relating to the constitution and legal status of the subscriber.
                </li>
                <li>The data concerning the extent and validity of the powers of representation of the applicant.
                </li>
                <li>The data concerning the tax identification code of the organisation or equivalent code used in the country to whose legislation the subscriber is subject.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The person controlling the above certificates will appoint a legal entity representative (LEAR) by generating and signing a Verifiable Credential which:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Includes identification data of an employee of the organisation
                </li>
                <li>Includes claims stating the delegation of specific powers to perform a set of specific processes on behalf of the organisation
                </li>
                <li>Includes a public key where the corresponding private key is controlled by the employee, enabling him to prove that he is the holder of the credential when it is being used in an authentication process like the ones used as examples in this document.
                </li>

            <p>The LEARCredential uses the <code>did:elsi</code> method for the identifiers of legal persons involved in the process, to facilitate the DID resolution and linkage with the eIDAS certificates. The <code>did:elsi</code> method is specified in <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[DID-ELSI]]]" href="https://alastria.github.io/did-method-elsi/">DID ETSI Legal person Semantic Identifier Method Specification (did:elsi)</a></cite>.

            <p>But <b>any entity can issue VerifiableIDs</b>, though the acceptance by Relying Parties can not be ensured because it is the Relying Party the only one deciding if it trusts on the issuer and its process for generating the VerifiableID.
            </p>
            <p>DOME will make use of the future eIDAS2 VerifiableIDs when they are available and when they make sense in the context of DOME. But DOME defines some specific types of VerifiableIDs that are derived from eIDAS certificates for signatures/seals using the regulated standards for signatures, achieving a level of assurance that provides an acceptable level of legal certainty and reduced risk of repudiation.
            </p>
            <p>An example is the LEARCredential described in a section above, which has the same level of legal certainty as any document signed with the same certificates (like a contract or an invoice).
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, a Product provider (like GoodAir) who decides to use the DOME Trust and IAM framework or a compatible one for managing access to associated services by customers of their products will typically define specific types of VerifiableIDs if the standard ones in DOME or the existing and widely accepted ones are not suitable for the provider. In general, if a provider can use an existing and already used VerifiableID then it will facilitate potential customers access to its product because issuers of the VerifiableID do not have to modify or adapt their existing issuing processes.

        <p>In this section we describe in detail the LEARCredential and for illustrative purpose we use example attributes from a fictitious ecosystem whose participants are described in Appendix <a href="#participants" class="xref">Example scenario: Participants in the ecosystem</a>.
        </p>
        <p>In this example the LEARCredential will be generated using the eIDAS certificate of the COO (Chief Operation Officer) of the organisation that will be issuing the credential.
        </p>
        <p>The credential will be generated with an application that the COO will use as Issuer of the LEARCredential and that allows the employee to receive the credential using his credential wallet, using [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.vci" title="OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance">OpenID.VCI</a></cite>] to achieve compliance with the EUDI Wallet ARF.
        </p>
        <p>This application enables the COO to attest the information required to create the LEARCredential, specifying the employee information and the specific type of LEARCredential. In general, there may be different instances of LEARCredentials for different purposes. One employee can have more than one LEARCredential, each having a different delegation of powers for different environments.
        </p>
        <p>The specific detailed use case here is the issuance of a LEARCredential to an employee to enable that employee to perform the onboarding process in an ecosystem. But exactly the same process with different attested attributes can be used by any organisation to issue credentials that can be accepted by other organisations for authentication and access control to any protected resources that they manage.
        </p>
        <p>The essential components of a LEARCredential are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Claims identifying the employee</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>DID of the employee to enable authentication</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Claims identifying the legal representative</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>The roles and duties of the LEAR</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Advanced/Qualified signature of the credential</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These concepts are elaborated in the following sections.
        </p>
        <section id="claims-identifying-the-employee"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-2-1-claims-identifying-the-employee"><bdi class="secno">2.2.1 </bdi>Claims identifying the employee</h4><a class="self-link" href="#claims-identifying-the-employee" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.2.1"></a></div>

            <p>These are claims identifying the subject of the credential, the person who will act as LEAR. Each ecosystem can define their own depending on their specific requirements.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, each organisation can specify their own for enabling access to its products/services. However, it is recommended to use a set of claims that are agreed upon by all participants in the ecosystem unless there are specific requirements for not doing so. This includes not only the amount of claims but also their syntax and semantics.
            </p>
            <p>For our example, we use the same that are used for accessing the European Commission portal. The claims in the credential are the digital equivalent of their analog counterparts, displayed here for illustration.

        <section id="did-of-the-employee"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-2-2-did-of-the-employee"><bdi class="secno">2.2.2 </bdi>DID of the employee</h4><a class="self-link" href="#did-of-the-employee" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.2.2"></a></div>

            <p>In this example we use the <code>did:key</code> method for the DID of the employee, which provides a very high level of privacy and given the way the LEARCredential is generated it supports the verification of the chain of responsibility with a proper level of guarantee.
            </p>
            <p>If the highest levels of assurance and legal compliance is desired and the employee has an eIDAS certificate for signatures (in this case a personal one, not one like the COO), we could use the <code>elsi:did</code> method for identification of the employee. However, the organisation (GoodAir in our example) should make sure that the employee is aware of and agree to the possible privacy implications of doing so, given the personal details leaked from the eIDAS certificate.
            </p>
            <p>Those personal details are exactly the same as if the employee signs any document with a digital certificate, but care should be taken by the organisation because in this case the signature would be done "on behalf of" his employer and not as an individual personal action.
            </p>
            <p>Even though this is not unique to the <code>did:elsi</code> method, this also implies that the onboarding service has to handle those personal details in the same way as if it would be accepting any other document signed with a certificate for signatures, and ensure compliance with GDPR. This is "business as usual" when using digital signatures, but we want to make sure that this is taken care of when implementing the authentication and access control mechanisms described here.
            </p>
            <p>In this example we assume the usage of the <code>did:key</code> method for the employee to protect his privacy as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>This DID for the employee is an additional claim to the ones presented above, using the <code>id</code> field in the <code>credentialSubject</code> object.
            </p>
            <p>Using this DID method has an additional advantage: the DID identifier corresponds to a keypair that is generated during the LEARCredential issuance process, where the private key is generated by the wallet of the employee and it is always under his control.
            </p>
            <p>This private key controlled by the employee can be used to sign challenges from Relying Parties that receive the credential to prove that the person sending the credential is the same person that is identified in the <code>credentialSubject</code> object of the LEARCredential.
            </p>
            <p>It is this property the one that makes this credential a VerifiableID that can be used for online authentication.
            </p>
            <p>An example DID for th employee could be:
            </p>

<table style="width:100%;"><tbody><tr><td class="codecolor">
<pre class="nohighlight precolor">{
    <span style="color:#000080">"id"</span>: <span style="color:#d14">"did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK"</span>
}</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

            <p>In this example, the signatures performed with the private key can not be JAdES-compliant ([<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-jades" title="ETSI TS 119 182-1 V1.1.1 (2021-03) - Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); JAdES digital signatures; Part 1: Building blocks and JAdES baseline signatures">ETSI-JADES</a></cite>]), but if the LEARCredential is attached to any other credential that is signed with this private key, then they can be traced up to the eIDAS certificate of the COO and so the chain of responsibility can be determined..
            </p>
            <p>With the DID for the employee, the set of claims identifying him would be then:

            <p>In this example we use what we call a <i>profile</i> of the [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.vci" title="OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance">OpenID.VCI</a></cite>] protocol. The standard is very flexible, and we restrict the different options available in the standard and implement a set of the options with given values that are adequate for our use case, without impacting flexibility in practice.
            </p>
            <p>The following figure describes the main components that interact in the issuance of a credential in this profile.
            </p>
            <p>The description of the issuance process is general enough to be used for many types of credentials, but the text includes notes describing the concrete application of the process to the case of the LEARCredential.

            </figure>
            <p><b>End user</b>
            </p>
            <p>This profile is valid for both natural and juridical persons, but because we are focusing on the issuance of the LEARCredential, in the detailed examples below we assume a natural person as the user.
            </p>
            <p><b>Wallet</b>
            </p>
            <p>The wallet is assumed to be a Web application with a wallet backend, maybe implemented as a PWA so it has some offline capabilities and can be installed in the device, providing a user experience similar to a native application. Private key management and most sensitive operations are performed in a backend server, operated by an entity trusted by the end user. Other profiles can support native and completely offline PWA mobile applications, for end users.
            </p>
            <p>This type of wallet supports natural persons, juridical persons and natural persons who are legal entity representatives of juridical persons. For juridical persons the wallet is usually called an <code>enterprise wallet</code> but we will use here just the term <code>wallet</code> unless the distinction is required.
            </p>
            <p>In this profile we assume that the wallet is not previously registered with the Issuer and that the wallet does not expose public endpoints that are called by the Issuer, even if the wallet has a backend server that could implement those endpoints. That makes the wallet implementations in this profile to be very similar in interactions to a full mobile implementation, making migration to a full mobile implementation easier.
            </p>
            <p>In other words, from the point of view of the Issuer, the wallet in this profile is almost indistinguishable from a full mobile wallet.
            </p>
            <p><b>User Laptop</b>
            </p>
            <p>For clarity of exposition, we assume in this profile that the End User starts the interactions with the Issuer with an internet browser (user agent) in her laptop. However, there is nothing in the interactions which limits those interactions to a laptop form factor and the End User can interact with any internet browser in any device (mobile, tablet, kiosk).
            </p>
            <p><b>Issuer</b>
            </p>
            <p>In this profile we assume that the Issuer is composed of two components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Authorization server</b>: the backend component implementing the existing authentication/authorization functionalities for the Issuer entity.
                </li>
                <li><b>Issuer backend</b>: the main server implementing the business logic as a web application and additional backend APIs required for issuance of credentials.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Issuer backend and the Authorization server could be implemented as a single component in an actual deployment, but we assume here that they are separated to make the profile more general, especially for big entities and also when using Trust Service Providers for cloud signature and credential issuance, for example.
            </p>
            <p><b>Authentication of End User and previous Issuer-End User relationship</b>
            </p>
            <p>We assume that the Issuer and End User have a previous relationship and that the Issuer has performed the KYC required by regulation and needed to be able to issue Verifiable Credentials attesting some attributes about the End User. We assume that there is an existing trusted authentication mechanism (not necessarily related to Verifiable Credentials) that the End User employs to access protected resources from the Issuer. For example, the user is an employee or a customer of the Issuer, or the Issuer is a Local Administration and the End User is a citizen living in that city.

            <p>Before requesting a new credential, the End User has to authenticate with the Issuer with whatever mechanism is already implemented by the Issuer. This profile does not require that it is based on OIDC, Verifiable Credentials or any other specific mechanism.
            </p>
            <p>The level of assurance (LoA) of this authentication mechanism is one of the factors that will determine the confidence that the Verifiers can have on the credentials received by them from a given Issuer.

                </p>
                <p>Being a modern company, GoodAir uses Verifiable Credentials IAM but this is not a requirement for the issuance of the LEARCredential.

            <p>In this profile the wallet does not have to implement the Credential Offer Endpoint described in section 4 of [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.vci" title="OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance">OpenID.VCI</a></cite>].
            </p>
            <p>Instead, the Credential Issuer renders a QR code containing a reference to the Credential Offer that can be scanned by the End-User using a Wallet, as described in section 4.1 of [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.vci" title="OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance">OpenID.VCI</a></cite>].
            </p>
            <p>According to the spec, the Credential Offer object is a JSON object containing the Credential Offer parameters and can be sent by value or by reference. To avoid problems with the size of the QR travelling in the URL, this profile requires that the QR contains the <code>credential_offer_uri</code>, which is a URL using the <code>https</code> scheme referencing a resource containing a JSON object with the Credential Offer parameters. The <code>credential_offer_uri</code> endpoint should be implemented by the Issuer backend.

                <p>This profile restricts the options available in section 4.1.1 of [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.vci" title="OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance">OpenID.VCI</a></cite>]. The profile defines a Credential Offer object containing the following parameters:

                <ul>
                    <li><code>credential_issuer</code>: <em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em>. The URL of the Credential Issuer that will be used by the Wallet to obtain one or more Credentials.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>credentials</code>: <em class="rfc2119">REQUIRED</em>. A JSON array, where every entry is a JSON string. To achieve interoperability faster, this profile defines a global Trusted Credential Schemas List where well-known credential schemas are defined, in addition to the individual credentials that each Issuer can define themselves. The string value <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be one of the id values in one of the objects in the <code>credentials_supported</code> metadata parameter of the Trusted Credential Schemas List (described later), or one of the id values in one of the objects in the <code>credentials_supported</code> Credential Issuer metadata parameter provided by the Credential Issuer. When processing, the Wallet <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> resolve this string value to the respective object. The credentials defined in the global Trusted Credential Schema List have precedence over the ones defined by the Credential Issuer.

This grant is represented by a key and an object, where the key is <code>urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:pre-authorized_code</code>. In this profile the credential issuance flow requires initial authentication of the End User by the Credential Issuer, so the Pre-Authorized Code Flow achieves a good level of security and we do not need the more general Authorization Code Flow.

                        <p>In other scenarios like when the wallet is a native mobile application and the user interacts with the Issuer exclusively with the mobile (without the laptop), then the Authorization Code Flow has to be used. This can be described in detail in a different profile.

This field is a boolean value specifying whether the Credential Issuer expects presentation of a user PIN along with the Token Request in a Pre-Authorized Code Flow. Default is false. This PIN is intended to bind the Pre-Authorized Code to a certain transaction in order to prevent replay of this code by an attacker that, for example, scanned the QR code while standing behind the legit user. It is <em class="rfc2119">RECOMMENDED</em> to send a PIN via a separate channel.

                    <p>In the example of a LEARCredential, the wallet generates a pair of public/private keys and a <code>did:key</code> identifier which is univocally related to the public key. This is the reason why the <code>kid</code> field above is exactly the DID identifier under this DID method. The <code>did:key</code> method is very simple and achieves a very high degree of privacy, allowing the creation of many different identifiers which can be one-use only if so desired.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <code>did:key</code> method is perfect for the requirements of our usage of the LEARCredential. Any other suitable DID method can be used if it is required, but this is out of scope for this profile.

            <p>Authentication requires a special type of Verifiable Credential called a VerifiableID. For the examples illustrating the mechanism we will use a LEARCredential, which is at the same time a VerifiableId and a Verifiable Authorization.
            </p>
            <p>For the explanation we will use the following figure which is based on <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[NIST-AUTH]]]" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-178.pdf">NIST Special Publication 800-178: A Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Standards for Data Service Applications</a></cite> which describes a reference architecture with necessary functional components to achieve authentication and enforcement of the authorization policies. The authorization process depends on four layers of functionality: <b>Enforcement</b>, <b>Decision</b>, <b>Access Control Data</b>, and <b>Administration</b>.
            </p>
            <p>The diagram uses the logical concepts also used in the XACML reference architecture, but the description is agnostic to the actual policy language used in a concrete implementation.
            </p>
            <p>In this description we assume that the user is a natural person who wants to access a protected resource. However, the architecture supports machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions. The differences will be described in the description when they are relevant.
            </p>
            <figure id="fig-architecture-overview"><img src="images/login_in_DOME/authn_architecture_numbered.drawio.png" />
            <figcaption><a class="self-link" href="#fig-architecture-overview">Figure <bdi class="figno">13</bdi></a> <span class="fig-title">Architecture overview</span></figcaption></figure>
            <p>The high level flow is the following:
            </p>
            <ul class="plain">
                <li id="983.1"><a href="#983.1" class="selfref"><b>1</b></a> The user sends a request to access a protected resource managed by the Relying Party.

                </li>
                <li id="985.2"><a href="#985.2" class="selfref"><b>2</b></a> Every request to a protected resource is intercepted by the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point). The PEP is normally implemented as a reverse proxy or API gateway, so all calls to protected resources entering the organisation are intercepted and forwarded only if they are accepted. If the request does not come with authentication information, there are several high level scenarios which are possible:

                    <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the user is a machine using an API, the request is rejected with an error. The caller is responsible for authenticating before retrying, which can be done using the metadata about the Relying Party available at the standard OpenID endpoints.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the user is a natural person using a browser for navigating the portal of the Relying Party, the typical approach is to redirect the browser to the authentication component using an HTTP Status of 302. The redirection includes enough information so the authentication component can send back the user to the original request if the user completes authentication successfully.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>Alternatively, the request can include authentication information which has been obtained before via an authentication process. If this is the case, the PEP goes directly into the authentication phase, described later in section <a href="#accesscontrol" class="xref">Access control with Verifiable Credentials</a>.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li id="994.3"><a href="#994.3" class="selfref"><b>3</b></a> The user is redirected to the authentication component. As mentioned before, alternatively the authorization component can be accessed directly by the user before trying to access the protected resource. This would be the expected behaviour of a user who knows that authentication is required. The mechanism described here supports all possible scenarios both for natural persons and machines.

                    <div>
                    <p>An example flow with a natural person would be: The user navigates first to a general Login page in the portal of the Relying Party and authenticates. After authentication the portal presents a collection of services that the user can access. The user selects one of the services/operations and the Relying Party executes the operation if the user is authorised to do so.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li id="998.4"><a href="#998.4" class="selfref"><b>4</b></a> The Verifiable Credentials verifier component of the Relying Party retrieves the credentials that are required for authentication. If the user has been redirected when trying to access a protected resource, the redirection provides information about the operation and protected resource that was trying to access, so there may be more credentials required than just a VerifiableID.

                    <div>
                    <p>If the user accessed directly the Login page, the VC Verifier component does not have information about the resource that the user intends to access, so it can request just a VerifiableID.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li id="1002.5"><a href="#1002.5" class="selfref"><b>5</b></a> The VC Verifier component of the Relying Party and the Wallet of the user engage in a Verifiable Presentation Exchange flow, where the result is that the VC Verifier receives a VerifiableID and possibly additional Verifiable Credentials as determined in step 4.

                </li>
                <li id="1004.6"><a href="#1004.6" class="selfref"><b>6</b></a> The authorization mechanism uses the Trust Framework to query different Trusted Lists that are needed to evaluate the policy rules applicable to the request and compute a decision.

                    <div>
                    <p>The Trust Framework is composed of one or more Trusted Lists where each list is specialised in some specific domain of trust.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>For example, the Trust Framework contains Trusted Lists with the schema definitions used for the well-known types of Verifiable Credentials in the ecosystem. In this way, if the Verifiable Registry used for the Trust Framework is based on a Blockchain network (or several federated networks), the schemas can be published in a trusted and resilient manner reducing the risk of malicious tampering and keeping a record of the history of modifications.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>But the most interesting Trusted Lists in the Trust Framework are the Trusted Issuers Lists, which provide the mechanism to efficiently and securely verify that the issuer of a given credential is a Trusted Issuer of that type of credentials.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>It has to be noticed that even though most Trusted Issuer Lists are global (used by all participants in the ecosystem) and have essentially public information, there may be some specialised lists that are private to one or more organisations and specialised in some specific requirement.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>In this way, there may be some lists that are specific to the products that one organisation provides to other participants in the ecosystem. For example, there may be a Trusted Issuer List private to one organisation which is updated with the identity of a participant when that participant acquires access to some product provided by that organisation.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>For example, this "product-specific" Trusted Issuer List is queried when performing authorization if the related policy rules specify that the issuer of the Verifiable Credential received in the request should have acquired the product that the request is trying to access.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>However, as mentioned before, the set of "internal" and "external" Trusted Lists to query is not hardcoded but it depends on the specific policy rules that should be applied to the request when computing the decision to grant access or not.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>In this way, the system provides a great deal of flexibility on how access control is performed.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>For simplicity, the diagram below shows the query of the Trusted Issuer Lists as a single interaction to a single box, but the actual interactions can be very complex if required. In addition, the diagram does not specify whether the list is "private" or "global".
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following sections elaborate in more detail in each of the interactions.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="starting-the-openid-for-verifiable-presentations-flow"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-4-2-starting-the-openid-for-verifiable-presentations-flow"><bdi class="secno">2.4.2 </bdi>Starting the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow</h4><a class="self-link" href="#starting-the-openid-for-verifiable-presentations-flow" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.4.2"></a></div>

            <p>In this section we assume that the user tries to access a protected resource and that the user is not authenticated. The flow when the user is already authenticated is the same, just skipping the authentication phase (steps 1 to 6).
            </p>
            <p>The authentication process starts an OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow combined with the Self-Issued OP v2 specification [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.siop2" title="Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2">OpenID.SIOP2</a></cite>], where the VC Verifier component of the portal plays the role of a Relying Party (RP in Open ID Connect terminology) and the wallet of the user is a Self-Issued IdP.
            </p>
            <p>In this step, the Verifier has to send an Authorization Request to the wallet. But as a Self-Issued OP may be running locally as a native application or progressive web application (PWA), the RP may not have a network-addressable endpoint to communicate directly with the OP. We have to leverage the implicit flow of OpenID Connect to communicate with such locally-running Ops, as described in [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.siop2" title="Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2">OpenID.SIOP2</a></cite>].
            </p>
            <p>We use a QR code to start the process and allow the wallet to receive the Authorization Request from the Verifier, and respond with an Authorization Response, sent to the Verifier in the body of an HTTP <code>POST</code> request.

As mentioned in the previous section, the Authorization Request is received as a JWT signed by the DOME onboarding service, using the eIDAS certificate for seals that corresponds to the legal person operating the service. This allows the wallet to verify that the signature corresponds to a real-world entity.

                    </p>
                    <p>If the Relying Party is a well known entity (like the DOME onboarding service in the case of DOME), it is easy to verify that the DID corresponds to the Relying Party.
                    </p>
                    <p>In most other cases, for example when the Relying Party is a participant in the ecosystem, we assume that the ecosystem provides a Trusted Participants Registry with an API compatible with the EBSI Trusted Issuers Registry, and that the participants registry is managed in a trusted way by the onboarding service (meaning that the Wallet user trusts on the onboarding service, in the same way as all other participants).
                    </p>
                    <p>In this case, to check if the DID is a participant on the ecosystem, the wallet sends a <code>GET /api/did/v1/identifiers/{did-to-verify}</code> request to the endpoint of one of several trusted servers implementing the functionality to query the Trusted Participant Registry, where <code>{did-to-verify}</code> is the actual DID the Wallet wants to check (in our example it would be <code>did:elsi:VATFR-99999999</code>, corresponding to the RP) . The API returns a JSON document as a DID Document. The DID Document (as per W3C) contains relevant information about the entity owner of the DID. It contains its Public Key, used to verify the digital signature of the entity. It also contains the status of the entity in the ecosystem. It is extensible and can contain any public information which may be relevant for the use case. The API must be operated by a trusted entity for the Wallet user. There may be as many servers implementing the API as needed and operated by different entities. At least one of those trusted entities has to be configured in the Wallet of the user, to facilitate the use of the wallet.

            <p>This section assumes that authentication has already been performed and that the Relying Party receives a request to a protected resource, with a proper access token inside the request. If the request does not come with an access token, the request is rejected immediately (or the user is redirected to the Authentication service of the Relying Party, depending on the use case).
            </p>
            <p>The Access Control mechanism described here is the same independently of whether the request comes from a user or a machine, so the M2M use case is supported without any modification. In the following description we will use the term <code>user</code> interchangeably for both the user as a natural person or the user as a machine.
            </p>
            <p>However, the assumption is that all machines have an identity (they are assigned an identifier), and that they are acting <code>on behalf of</code> a legally valid identity in the sense of eIDAS2. In other words, we require that the identities of users and machines can be cryptographically bound to the real-world identity of either a natural person or a legal person in a way that provides legal certainty to the Relying Party regarding the chain of responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>If the user is a natural person using the portal of the Relying Party, the request to the protected resource will come from the browser that the user employs to navigate the portal, and the access token will be included automatically by the browser in every request that is sent ot the Relying Party, for example when the user clicks a button or fills a form.
            </p>
            <p>If the user is a server or device, it is assumed that it has obtained an access token previously as the result of an authentication process described above. The server or device is responsible for including the access token in every request that is sent to the Relying Party to access a protected resource.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal of the Relying Party is an onboarding process (eg., the portal of the DOME Onboarding service), the protected resource could be the onboarding service itself, or a service to upload additional information for a partially completed onboarding process.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal is a Marketplace and the organisation using the portal wants to offer products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Seller</i>, or to create a Product specification and offering.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal is the Marketplace and the organisation wants to contract products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Customer</i>, or to launch a procurement order of a product.
            </p>
            <p>The same mechanism can be used by any participant in the ecosystem, if they want to use an advanced IAM mechanism which is aligned with the EU strategy on digital identity based on Verifiable Credential and eIDAS2.
            </p>
            <p>For the explanation we will use the following figure which is based on <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[NIST-AUTH]]]" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-178.pdf">NIST Special Publication 800-178: A Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Standards for Data Service Applications</a></cite> which describes a reference architecture with necessary functional components to achieve enforcement the authorization policies. The authorization process depends on four layers of functionality: <b>Enforcement</b>, <b>Decision</b>, <b>Access Control Data</b>, and <b>Administration</b>.

            <p>Every request to a protected resource is intercepted by the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point), and to know if the request should be authorised or not, the PEP asks to the PDP (Policy Decision Point) for a decision. The PDP needs to know what are the policy rules that should be applied to the request, and it uses the PRP (Policy Retrieval Point) to retrieve those policies.

The PEP is normally implemented as a reverse proxy or API gateway, so all calls to protected resources entering the organisation are intercepted and forwarded if they are accepted.

<div>
                    <p>After inspecting the request, the PEP requests a decision from the PDP passing a series of attributes. In general, the request from the PEP to the PDP consists of <b>subject</b> attributes (typically for the user who issued the request), <b>resource</b> attributes (the resource for which access is sought), <b>action</b> attributes (the operations to be performed on the resource), and <b>environment</b> attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of the above attributes are obtained by the PEP from the original request received from the user. For example, the HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and the URL and possibly the body of the request provide action attributes. Specifically, in the case of an NGSI-LD request those attributes are formally specified in the NGSI-LD standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>The subject attributes most relevant for access control are located in the access token received with the request. In particular, the access token includes the Verifiable Credentials that were employed for authentication, and the claims in those credentials can be used to evaluate access control policies. This includes (but is not limited to) the roles object that may be included in the VerifiableID credential used for authentication.
                    </p>

                    <p>Environmental attributes, which depend on the availability of system sensors that can detect and report values, are somewhat different from subject and resource attributes, which are administratively created. Environmental attributes are not properties of the subject or resources, but are measurable characteristics that pertain to the operational or situational context in which access requests occur. These environmental characteristics are subject and resource independent, and may include the current time, day of the week, or threat level.
                    </p>
                    <p>The PDP computes decisions to permit or deny subject requests to perform actions on resources. In computing a decision, the PDP queries policies stored in a PRP (Policy Retrieval Point).
                    </p>
                    <p>If the attributes of the request are not sufficient for rule and policy evaluation, the PDP may need to search the PIP for additional attributes. The PIP is shown as one logical store, but in fact may comprise multiple physical stores of different types.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to the PIP, the PDP uses one or more Trusted Issuers Lists (to check if the issuer of the credential is included in them as a trusted issuer of that type of credential), and also the Authorization Registry (AR), which can check for finer granularity authorisation records which may be very dynamic in nature (e.g. if some resource usage by employees and machines owned by the issuer have exceeded some quota this month).
                    </p>
                    <p>The actual Trusted Issuers Lists that the PDP needs to check is determined by the policy rules retrieved from the PRP. Those policy rules also determine the additional queries performed to the PIP data stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>The set of information and data stored in the PIP and PRP comprise the access control data and collectively define the current authorization state, which the PDP will use to compute its decision.

            <p>After retrieving the policies from the PRP, the PDP determines what are the attributes needed by the policy rules to perform its evaluation. Some of those attributes can be determined from the request received (e.g., claims inside the Verifiable Credential(s) in the access token). But in general, the policy rules require additional attributes that have to be retrieved from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>The two logical sources of those attributes are the PIP and the Trusted Issuers Lists in the Trust Anchor Framework.
            </p>
            <p>The concept of the PIP is the same as in the standard XACML logical architecture, essentially enabling the PDP to retrieve environmental attributes required for policy evaluation.

            <p>In our approach using Verifiable Credentials for authentication and authorization, we use a Trust Framework to determine if the credentials received in the request are issued by authorised issuers of those credentials.
            </p>
            <p>The PDP does not have hardcoded the actual Trusted Lists to query, but they are determined dynamically from the policies retrieved from the PRP. In simple use cases there may be one or two lists to query which are the same for all requests. But the mechanism described here can cater for very complex scenarios where the lists may be different depending on the requests and also from the dynamic environmental information retrieved from the PIP.

            <p>The authorization mechanism uses the Trust Framework to query different Trusted Lists that are needed to evaluate the policy rules applicable to the request and compute a decision.
            </p>
            <p>The Trust Framework is composed of one or more Trusted Lists where each list is specialised in some specific domain of trust.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the Trust Framework contains Trusted Lists with the schema definitions used for the well-known types of Verifiable Credentials in the ecosystem. In this way, if the Verifiable Registry used for the Trust Framework is based on a Blockchain network (or several federated networks), the schemas can be published in a trusted and resilient manner reducing the risk of malicious tampering and keeping a record of the history of modifications.
            </p>
            <p>But the most interesting Trusted Lists in the Trust Framework are the Trusted Issuers Lists, which provide the mechanism to efficiently and securely verify that the issuer of a given credential is a Trusted Issuer of that type of credentials.
            </p>
            <p>It has to be noticed that even though most Trusted Issuer Lists are global (used by all participants in the ecosystem) and have essentially public information, there may be some specialised lists that are private to one or more organisations and specialised in some specific requirement.
            </p>
            <p>In this way, there may be some lists that are specific to the products that one organisation provides to other participants in the ecosystem. For example, there may be a Trusted Issuer List private to one organisation which is updated with the identity of a participant when that participant acquires access to some product provided by that organisation.
            </p>
            <p>For example, this "product-specific" Trusted Issuer List is queried when performing authorization if the related policy rules specify that the issuer of the Verifiable Credential received in the request should have acquired the product that the request is trying to access.
            </p>
            <p>However, as mentioned before, the set of "internal" and "external" Trusted Lists to query is not hardcoded but it depends on the specific policy rules that should be applied to the request when computing the decision to grant access or not.
            </p>
            <p>In this way, the system provides a great deal of flexibility on how access control is performed.
            </p>
            <p>For simplicity, the diagram below shows the query of the Trusted Issuer Lists as a single interaction to a single box, but the actual interactions can be very complex if required. In addition, the diagram does not specify whether the list is "private" or "global".

    <p>RealTruth is a Trust Service Provider operating under the eIDAS Trust Framework, which issues a certificate for seals to the company GoodAir. GoodAir is a business that provides some services using an Air Quality application operated by GoodAir.
    </p>
    <p>RealTruth also provides a certificate for signatures to the COO of the GoodAir company, so the COO can use the certificate to sign documents on behalf of GoodAir (like contracts, invoices, financial reports, ...) in a way that is compliant with eIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>The COO of GoodAir will issue a verifiable credential of type LEARCredential to an employee of GoodAir, signing the credential with his certificate for signatures.

Such a scope value <em class="rfc2119">MUST</em> be an alias for a well-defined presentation definition as it will be referred to in the <code>presentation_submission</code> response parameter.
    </p>
    <p>In this specification we define concrete scope values and the mapping between a certain scope value and the respective presentation definition, in particular the mapping between scope values and specific types of Verifiable Credentials used for access control in the use case described in this document. In a production implementation of a Data Space ecosystem, the Trust Framework has to define the mappings used in the ecosysyem and the mechanisms and governance model used to update those mappings.
    </p>
    <p>In this example we only need the mapping for the LEARCredential, where the scope <code>dome.credentials.presentation.LEARCredential</code> represents the following presentation definition:

<section id="abstract" class="introductory"><h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>We describe here a mechanism to use Verifiable Credentials to perform Authentication and Access Control leveraging the eIDAS trust framework and using advanced or qualified signatures and seals to provide a high level of legal certainty and specially enjoying the presumption of non-repudiation provided by those eIDAS signatures.

        <p>In a typical B2B ecosystem, the agreements between a product/service provider and the consumer are formalised among legal persons (also known in this document as 'organisations').
        </p>
        <p>However, when interacting in the context of execution of the agreement, typically other entities are acting on behalf of the legal persons both for the consumer organisation and for the service provider organisation.
        </p>
        <p>For example an employee of the consumer organisation may start, on behalf of his employer, an interaction with the provider organisation to perform a process needed for the provision of a service. In this case, the provider organisation should authenticate the natural person and apply appropriate access control policies to ensure that the natural person is really entitled by the consumer organisation to perform the intended process.
        </p>
        <p>In the context of authentication and access management, the legal entity acting as consumer organisation will be named <code>Participant</code>. The digital representation of a natural person, acting on behalf of a Participant, is referred to as a <code>Principal</code>. When the context is clear and we need to refer to eIDAS legal terms, we will use the term <code>user</code> (defined in the Glossary) to denote a natural or legal person, or a natural person representing a legal person using a wallet to authenticate.
        </p>
        <p>The legal entity acting as service provider and performing authentication and access management will be called <code>Relying Party</code>.
        </p>
        <p>We describe here a mechanism to use Verifiable Credentials to perform Authentication and Access Control leveraging the eIDAS trust framework and using advanced or qualified signatures and seals to provide a high level of legal certainty and specially enjoying the presumption of non-repudiation provided by those eIDAS signatures.
        </p>
        <table style="width:100%;"><tbody><tr><td class="xwarnt"><aside class="xwarna">

            <p>We focus here on <code>legal persons</code>. It is out of scope the identification and authentication of <code>natural persons</code> (except when acting as representatives of the legal person, see below). Whenever eIDAS2 and the EUDIW (European Digital Identity Wallet) are ready, we will support that mechanism for identification and access control.
            </p>
        </aside></td></tr></tbody></table>
        <p>The mechanism described here allows a Relying Party receiving a Verifiable Credential from a principal engaging in an authentication process to perform the following verifications:
        </p>
        <ul class="plain">
            <li id="160.Authentication"><a href="#160.Authentication" class="selfref"><b>Authentication</b></a>

                <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Non-tampering</b>. The Relying Party can verify that the credential was not tampered with since it was generated, thanks to the digital signature of the credential.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Binding the Principal with the subject inside the credential</b>. The Relying Party can verify that the principal presenting the credential is the same principal identified as the subject inside the credential by using the cryptographic material inside the credential that was embedded in a secure and private way during the credential issuance process. See section <a href="#verifiableid" class="xref">Authentication requires a VerifiableID</a> for more details.
                        <div>
                        <p>The degree of trust in this verification depends on the degree of trust that the Relying Party puts on the processes that the Participant uses to issue the credentials.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>However, as described below, the usage of eIDAS signatures to sign the credential makes the Participant legally liable for any problems in the binding of the identities of the holder and subject of the credential. Specifically, compliance to the eIDAS specifications and regulation for electronic seals and signatures provides <b>presumption of non-repudiation and the burden of proof in the courts rests on the Participant, not on the Relying Party</b>.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>This is important because it provides the incentives in the proper places: the Participant is incentivised to create the credential in the proper way, and the Relying Party is incentivised to perform its due diligence in verifying the credential. By using the eIDAS signatures, no party has to assume the burden if the technical validity of the signature is disputed in court. Only the contents of the credential can be under discussion. See section <a href="#signature_benefits" class="xref">Signature of the Verifiable Credentials</a> for more details.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>In the proposal of this document, the verification is enabled by embedding inside the credential a public key corresponding to a private key that was generated by the principal during the issuance process. See below for the details, including an optional mechanism by embedding an existing eIDAS certificate issued by a QTSP when the principal is a natural person or a legal person (different from the Participant).
                        </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><b> Binding of issuer with a real-world identity</b>. The Relying Party can verify that the credential was issued by somebody controlling a private key associated to a given real-world identity.
                        <div>
                        <p>The verification is enabled because the Verifiable Credential is sealed with an eIDAS qualified certificate for electronic seals issued to the Participant by an EU Qualified Trusted Services Provider (QTSP), and the signature of the credential is an advanced or qualified electronic signature using the format JAdES (JSON Advanced Electronic Signature) as defined in the eIDAS regulation.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>Of course, we also support electronic signatures with qualified certificates for electronic signatures issued by QTSPs to <b>natural persons acting as representatives of legal persons</b>.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>This verification ensures that an organisation with a real-world legal identity under the eIDAS Trust Framework has signed the credential being presented by a natural person identified as the subject of the credential.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>This verification <b>does not say anything about whether the organisation is a participant</b> in a given Data Space or not. See next point for such verification.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Verify that the real-world identity is a Participant</b>. The Relying Party, using the unique identifier associated to the eIDAS certificate used to sign the credential, can check if the issuer of the credential is a participant in a given Data Space by looking for that unique identifier in the Trusted Participant List managed by that Data Space.
                        <div>
                        <p>This unique number is the unique <code>organizationIdentifier</code> inside the certificates for legal persons and certificates for natural persons acting as representatives of legal persons, defined in <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[ETSI-LEGALPERSON]]]" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/319400_319499/31941203/01.02.01_60/en_31941203v010201p.pdf">ETSI EN 319 412-3 V1.2.1 (2020-07) - Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); Certificate Profiles; Part 3: Certificate profile for certificates issued to legal persons</a></cite>.

                        <p>Any legal person that can already engage in electronic transactions in the internal market has an eIDAS certificate including such a unique identifier, which is used in all types of legally-binding signatures like invoices, contracts, etc.
                        </p>

                        <div>
                        <p>We assume here that the onboarding process of each Data Space / Ecosystem does not invent a new "local-only" identifier but uses the one that is already valid for electronic transactions in the internal market. Or at least, that the global eIDAS unique identifier is associated with whatever private identifier is invented by the Data Space.
                        </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                        <p>We assume that the eIDAS unique identifier is used during onboarding to update a given Trusted Participant List with the identity of the new participant. That identity is composed of the unique identifier in the eIDAS framework and any additional attributes that may be relevant for the ecosystem. See below for the structure of the unique eIDAS identifier.

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Binding the Participant to the delegated powers to the Principal</b>. The Relying Party can verify that the legal person (the Participant) or a representative of the legal person (in eIDAS terms) has delegated a specific set of powers to the subject identified inside the credential (who is the same person holding and presenting the credential, as described above in 'authentication').
                            <div>
                            <p>This is enabled because the credential includes a <b>set of claims that state in a formal language the delegated powers</b>, and the credential has been sealed/signed using an eIDAS certificate using the eIDAS advanced/qualified electronic signature format, described in more detail later in this document.
                            </p>

                            <p>Alternatively, the credential can include a pointer to an external document (which could be another credential) describing in detail the delegated powers.

                            </div>
                            <div>
                            <p>Thanks to the usage of eIDAS signatures, the credential is effectively a legal document with the same legal validity as any other document in any format supported by the eIDAS signature scheme. The Relying Party can verify (and prove in court if needed) with a high level of legal certainty that the legal person issuing the credential (the Participant) has declared that the holder/subject of the credential has the powers stated inside the credential (or linked by the credential).
                            </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            <p>Actually, the entity identified as a subject in the credential, and that is receiving the delegated powers, is not restricted to be a natural person and can be of different types. Anything that can be expressed in paper or PDF format can be also expressed in the Verifiable Credential format. For example, it can be an employee, a customer or a machine or device under the responsibility of the legal person signing the credential.
                            </p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Relying Party can use the claims mentioned above, expressed as a formal language (e.g. ODRL), to perform access control. The specific mechanism is not yet detailed in this document.
                            <div>
                            <p>For example, the credential can just specify the role(s) of the entity identified in the credential (e.g. 'Finance Administrator') and the Relying Party can evaluate a set of arbitrarily complex policy rules associated to the role(s) for access control.
                            </p>
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            <p>Alternatively, the credential could specify more complex rules which the Relying Party can combine if needed with additional policy rules to make the final decision.
                            </p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                
            
        </ul>
        <p>To achieve all of the above, we define specific types of Verifiable Credentials with a format and a mechanism which specify:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>a way to sign the credentials;
            </li>
            <li>a way to bind the identity of the holder of a credential to the identity of the subject inside the credential;
            </li>
            <li>and a way to embed authorisation information in the credential describing the powers that the legal entity has delegated to the subject inside the credential.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The mechanisms described here can be used to generate credentials to employees, contractors, customers and even to machines and devices acting on behalf of an organisation. The schema is identical, except the issuance process is probably a little bit different and the roles and duties embedded in the credentials have different legal implications (but always in line with the legal framework, for example with the Consumer Protection Directive).

            <p>We use <code>qualified certificates for electronic seals</code> provided by eIDAS Qualified Trust Services Providers (QTSPs) to seal credentials with advanced electronic seals (AdESeal) or with qualified electronic seals (QESeal) with the JSON Advanced Electronic Signature format (JAdES).
            </p>
            <p>We also use <code>qualified certificates for electronic signatures</code> issued by a QTSP to authorised representatives of the legal person, to sign credentials with advanced electronic signatures (AdES) or with qualified electronic signatures (QES) with the JSON Advanced Electronic Signature format (JAdES).
            </p>
            <p>This mechanism for sealing/signing the Verifiable Credentials has the following properties:
            </p>
            <ul class="plain">
                <li><b>Provides high assurance of the identity of the creator of the credential.</b>
                    <div>
                    <p>The seals/signatures provide <b>high assurance of the identity of the creator of the seal</b>. For example, it will be difficult for a malicious user to get a qualified seal certificate in the name of a company, because the QTSP will be responsible to check that such seal is issued to the persons representing the company and not to unauthorised persons.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><b>Enables authorised representative of the legal person to act on behalf of the legal person.</b>
                    <div>
                    <p>The mechanism provides <b>high legal predictability</b>, including for the qualified electronic signature the benefits of its <b>legal equivalence to handwritten signatures</b>.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>As stated by the eIDAS Regulation, when a transaction requires a qualified electronic seal from a legal person, a qualified electronic signature from the authorised representative of the legal person should be equally acceptable.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>It is possible to certify elements that are bound to the signatory such as a title (e.g. Director), a link with its employer, etc. Because the QTSP is trusted for verifying the information it certifies, the Relying Party can get a high level of confidence in such information conveyed with the signature through the signatory's certificate.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>In this way, the Relying Party receiving Verifiable Credentials can have the same legal certainty than with any other document in other formats (e.g. PDF) signed with AdES or QES signatures or with handwritten signatures (in the case of QES).
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><b>Provides high level of legal certainty and interoperability.</b>
                    <div>
                    <p>Any basic signature benefits from the non-discrimination rule, which means that a Court in an EU Member State cannot reject it automatically as being invalid simply because they are in electronic form.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>However, their dependability is lower than that of an AdES/AdESeal or QES/QESeal because the signatory may be required to prove the security of the technology being used if the validity of the signature is disputed before a court. This requires significant costs and efforts that could be avoided with relative ease by opting for the more established and standardised advanced and qualified signature solutions. It may also be the case that the relying parties have no applications or tools to validate such signature, when not based on standards; in such a scenario, the signature may be legally valid and technologically robust, but of limited use (see [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-enisa-qes" title="Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic signatures">ENISA-QES</a></cite>] and [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-enisa-qseal" title="Security guidelines on the appropriate use of qualified electronic seals">ENISA-QSEAL</a></cite>]).
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>For these interoperability reasons, QES/QESeal that are based on recognised EU standards are preferable unless the parties operate purely in a local context where the acceptance and usability of the chosen signature solution is sufficiently certain.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>Beyond the technical interoperability, the eIDAS Regulation also ensures the international recognition of electronic signatures, and not limited to the EU.

            <p>The objectives defined in the introduction can be achieved in different ways. We define here an approach that standardises the detailed mechanisms so it can be adopted easily by anyone who wants to obtain the associated benefits. If the approach is adopted in an ecosystem, it provides a high level of interoperability among the participants in the ecosystem, reducing also the risks associated to mistakes in the implementation.
            </p>
            <p>To describe precisely the approach, we define a taxonomy of the relevant classes of Verifiable Credentials that we need.
            </p>
            <p>For the purpose of this discussion we use a diagram derived from the taxonomy <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/Data+Models+and+Schemas">defined in EBSI</a>:

            <p>The sections below refer to this diagram for each type of credential discussed.

        <section id="verifiableid"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-1-3-authentication-requires-a-verifiableid"><bdi class="secno">2.1.3 </bdi>Authentication requires a VerifiableID</h4><a class="self-link" href="#verifiableid" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.1.3"></a></div>

            <p>Not all types of Verifiable Credentials can be used as a mechanism for online authentication, because the Relying Party (the entity receiving the Verifiable Credential in an authentication process) needs to bind the identity of the user sending the credential to the claims attested about the subject inside the credential.
            </p>
            <p>For example, in the case of a Diploma as a Verifiable Credential (a Verifiable Diploma), the credential is a Verifiable Attestation which indicates that the subject has certain skills or has achieved certain learning outcomes through formal or non-formal learning context. However, as in the case with normal Diplomas in paper of PDF format, this credential can be presented by anyone that holds the credential. In other words, the credential binds the identity of the subject with the claims inside the credential, but does not bind the identity of the holder of the credential with the identity of the subject of the credential, which requires a special mechanism in the issuance process.
            </p>
            <p>Most Verifiable Credentials will be issued as Verifiable Attestations, acting as efficient machine-processable and verifiable equivalent to their analog counterparts. Their purpose is to attest some attributes about the subject of the credential and not act as a mechanism for online authentication.
            </p>
            <p>Instead, <b>a <code>VerifiableID</code> is a special form of a Verifiable Credential that a natural or legal person can use in an electronic identification process as evidence of whom he/she/it is</b> (comparable with a passport, physical IDcard, driving licence, social security card, member-card…).
            </p>
            <p>VerifiableIDs can be of different types and be issued by different entities with different levels of assurance (in eIDAS terminology). They are issued with the purpose of serving as authentication mechanisms in online processes. In the near future, VerifiableIDs of the highest level of assurance (LoA High) will be issued to citizens and businesses by their governments under eIDAS2.
            </p>
            <p>We describe in this document a way to issue VerifiableID credentials and how a Relying Party can perform authentication by accepting that credential.
            </p>

        <section id="access-control-requires-a-verifiable-authorisation"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-1-4-access-control-requires-a-verifiable-authorisation"><bdi class="secno">2.1.4 </bdi>Access Control requires a Verifiable Authorisation</h4><a class="self-link" href="#access-control-requires-a-verifiable-authorisation" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.1.4"></a></div>

            <p>Once the user is authenticated, the system should make a decision to grant or reject an access request to a protected resource from an already authenticated subject, based on what the subject is authorised to access.
            </p>
            <p>Let's take the example of when a Service Provider signs an agreement with a Service Consumer organisation (a legal person), and the Service Provider wants to allow access to some services to employees of the Consumer organisation under the conditions of the agreement.
            </p>
            <p>In most cases, granting access is not an all-or-nothing decision. In general, the agreement between the Service Provider and Service Consumer specifies that only a subset of the employees of the Consumer organisation can access the services, and even in that subset not all employees have the same powers when accessing the services. For example, some employees have access to the administration of the service, some can perform some create/update/delete operations in a subset of the services, and some employees can only have read access to a subset of the services.
            </p>
            <p>To allow for this granularity in an authentication and access control process, in general the entity willing to perform an action on a protected resource has to present (in a Verifiable Presentation) a VerifiableID and possibly one or more additional Verifiable Attestations.
            </p>
            <p>At least one of the credentials should include claims identifying the employee (or any other subject) and a formal description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation, enabling the determination by the Service Provider whether the user is entitled to access a service and the operations that the user can perform on that service.
            </p>
            <p>We define later a standard mechanism and format for a Verifiable Credential that enables this functionality in a simple, secure and with high degree of legal certainty compatible with eIDAS.
            </p>
            <p>Such a credential is called a Verifiable Authorization, represented in the figure above.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="combining-verifiableid-and-verifiable-authorisation-in-the-learcredential"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-1-5-combining-verifiableid-and-verifiable-authorisation-in-the-learcredential"><bdi class="secno">2.1.5 </bdi>Combining VerifiableID and Verifiable Authorisation in the LEARCredential</h4><a class="self-link" href="#combining-verifiableid-and-verifiable-authorisation-in-the-learcredential" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.1.5"></a></div>

            <p>In many use cases, it is possible to simplify the authentication and access control by combining in a single credential both a VerifiableID (authentication) and a Verifiable Authorisation (for access control).
            </p>
            <p>The resulting credential is called LEARCredential and it is very useful when the holder/subject wants to use decentralised IAM mechanisms implemented by Relying Parties which are federated in a decentralised way using a common Trust Anchor Framework.
            </p>
            <p>The concept of LEARCredential is described in the diagram above.
            </p>
            <p>The appointed employee will perform the process by using a special type of Verifiable Credential called <code>LEARCredential</code> (from <b>L</b>egal <b>E</b>ntity <b>A</b>ppointed <b>R</b>epresentative).
            </p>
            <p>To achieve a high level of legal certainty under eIDAS, the LEARCredential is:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>signed or sealed with an eIDAS certificate which is either:
                    <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a <b>certificate for electronic seals</b> issued to a legal person by a Qualified Trust Service Provider, or
                        </li>
                        <li>a <b>certificate for electronic signatures</b>, issued to a <b>legal representative of the legal person</b> by a Qualified Trust Service Provider.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li>signed using the <b>JSON Advanced Electronic Signature</b> format described in <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[ETSI-JADES]]]" href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/119100_119199/11918201/01.01.01_60/ts_11918201v010101p.pdf">ETSI TS 119 182-1 V1.1.1 (2021-03) - Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); JAdES digital signatures; Part 1: Building blocks and JAdES baseline signatures</a></cite>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The LEARCredential includes claims identifying the employee and a description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation.
            </p>
            <p>By signing/sealing the credential with an eIDAS certificate, the legal representative attests that the powers described in the credential have been delegated to the employee (maybe under some conditions, also described in the credential).
            </p>
            <p>In this way, the LEARCredential has the same legal status as any other document in other formats (e.g., PDF) signed in an eIDAS-compliant way, but with all the advantages provided by the Verifiable Credential format.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, the LEARCredential includes cryptographic material that allows the appointed employee to <b>use the credential as an online authentication mechanism</b> in a portal, by proving that the holder of the credential is the same person identified in the credential.
            </p>
            <p>Any Verifier that trusts the eIDAS Trust Framework will be able to verify that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The person presenting the LEARCredential is the same as the one identified in the credential</b>
                </li>
                <li><b>A legal representative of the organisation has attested that the person has the powers described in the credential</b>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This enables the person presenting the LEARCredential to start the process and to provide any additional required documentation, preferably as additional Verifiable Credentials to enable automatic verification of compliance with the process requirements (including Gaia-X credentials issued by the Compliance Service of Gaia-X).
            </p>
            <p>Both types of eIDAS certificates mentioned above are an electronic attestation <b>that links electronic seal/signature validation data to a legal person and confirms the name of that person</b>. This way, the certificate, usually linked to the sealed/signed document, can be used to verify the identity of the creator of the seal/signature and whether the document has been sealed/signed using the corresponding private key.
            </p>
            <p>Before issuing a certificate like the above, the Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) performs validations against <code>Authentic Sources</code> to authenticate the identity of the organisation:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The data concerning the business name or corporate name of the organisation.
                </li>
                <li>The data relating to the constitution and legal status of the subscriber.
                </li>
                <li>The data concerning the extent and validity of the powers of representation of the applicant.
                </li>
                <li>The data concerning the tax identification code of the organisation or equivalent code used in the country to whose legislation the subscriber is subject.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The person controlling the above certificates will appoint a legal entity representative (LEAR) by generating and signing a Verifiable Credential which:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Includes identification data of an employee of the organisation
                </li>
                <li>Includes claims stating the delegation of specific powers to perform a set of specific processes on behalf of the organisation
                </li>
                <li>Includes a public key where the corresponding private key is controlled by the employee, enabling him to prove that he is the holder of the credential when it is being used in an authentication process like the ones used as examples in this document.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The LEARCredential uses the <code>did:elsi</code> method for the identifiers of legal persons involved in the process, to facilitate the DID resolution and linkage with the eIDAS certificates. The <code>did:elsi</code> method is specified in <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[DID-ELSI]]]" href="https://alastria.github.io/did-method-elsi/">DID ETSI Legal person Semantic Identifier Method Specification (did:elsi)</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <p>The high-level view of the process is described in the following diagram, when a COO (Chief Operating Officer) appoints an employee to perform some processes:

            <p>But <b>any entity can issue VerifiableIDs</b>, though the acceptance by Relying Parties can not be ensured because it is the Relying Party the only one deciding if it trusts on the issuer and its process for generating the VerifiableID.
            </p>
            <p>DOME will make use of the future eIDAS2 VerifiableIDs when they are available and when they make sense in the context of DOME. But DOME defines some specific types of VerifiableIDs that are derived from eIDAS certificates for signatures/seals using the regulated standards for signatures, achieving a level of assurance that provides an acceptable level of legal certainty and reduced risk of repudiation.
            </p>
            <p>An example is the LEARCredential described in a section above, which has the same level of legal certainty as any document signed with the same certificates (like a contract or an invoice).
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, a Product provider (like GoodAir) who decides to use the DOME Trust and IAM framework or a compatible one for managing access to associated services by customers of their products will typically define specific types of VerifiableIDs if the standard ones in DOME or the existing and widely accepted ones are not suitable for the provider. In general, if a provider can use an existing and already used VerifiableID then it will facilitate potential customers access to its product because issuers of the VerifiableID do not have to modify or adapt their existing issuing processes.

        <p>In this section we describe in detail the LEARCredential and for illustrative purpose we use example attributes from a fictitious ecosystem whose participants are described in Appendix <a href="#participants" class="xref">Example scenario: Participants in the ecosystem</a>.
        </p>
        <p>In this example the LEARCredential will be generated using the eIDAS certificate of the COO (Chief Operation Officer) of the organisation that will be issuing the credential.
        </p>
        <p>The credential will be generated with an application that the COO will use as Issuer of the LEARCredential and that allows the employee to receive the credential using his credential wallet, using [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.vci" title="OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance">OpenID.VCI</a></cite>] to achieve compliance with the EUDI Wallet ARF.
        </p>
        <p>This application enables the COO to attest the information required to create the LEARCredential, specifying the employee information and the specific type of LEARCredential. In general, there may be different instances of LEARCredentials for different purposes. One employee can have more than one LEARCredential, each having a different delegation of powers for different environments.
        </p>
        <p>The specific detailed use case here is the issuance of a LEARCredential to an employee to enable that employee to perform the onboarding process in an ecosystem. But exactly the same process with different attested attributes can be used by any organisation to issue credentials that can be accepted by other organisations for authentication and access control to any protected resources that they manage.
        </p>
        <p>The essential components of a LEARCredential are the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Claims identifying the employee</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>DID of the employee to enable authentication</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Claims identifying the legal representative</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>The roles and duties of the LEAR</b>
            </li>
            <li><b>Advanced/Qualified signature of the credential</b>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These concepts are elaborated in the following sections.

            <p>These are claims identifying the subject of the credential, the person who will act as LEAR. Each ecosystem can define their own depending on their specific requirements.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, each organisation can specify their own for enabling access to its products/services. However, it is recommended to use a set of claims that are agreed upon by all participants in the ecosystem unless there are specific requirements for not doing so. This includes not only the amount of claims but also their syntax and semantics.
            </p>
            <p>For our example, we use the same that are used for accessing the European Commission portal. The claims in the credential are the digital equivalent of their analog counterparts, displayed here for illustration.

        <section id="did-of-the-employee"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-2-2-did-of-the-employee"><bdi class="secno">2.2.2 </bdi>DID of the employee</h4><a class="self-link" href="#did-of-the-employee" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.2.2"></a></div>

            <p>In this example we use the <code>did:key</code> method for the DID of the employee, which provides a very high level of privacy and given the way the LEARCredential is generated it supports the verification of the chain of responsibility with a proper level of guarantee.
            </p>
            <p>If the highest levels of assurance and legal compliance is desired and the employee has an eIDAS certificate for signatures (in this case a personal one, not one like the COO), we could use the <code>elsi:did</code> method for identification of the employee. However, the organisation (GoodAir in our example) should make sure that the employee is aware of and agree to the possible privacy implications of doing so, given the personal details leaked from the eIDAS certificate.
            </p>
            <p>Those personal details are exactly the same as if the employee signs any document with a digital certificate, but care should be taken by the organisation because in this case the signature would be done "on behalf of" his employer and not as an individual personal action.
            </p>
            <p>Even though this is not unique to the <code>did:elsi</code> method, this also implies that the onboarding service has to handle those personal details in the same way as if it would be accepting any other document signed with a certificate for signatures, and ensure compliance with GDPR. This is "business as usual" when using digital signatures, but we want to make sure that this is taken care of when implementing the authentication and access control mechanisms described here.
            </p>
            <p>In this example we assume the usage of the <code>did:key</code> method for the employee to protect his privacy as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>This DID for the employee is an additional claim to the ones presented above, using the <code>id</code> field in the <code>credentialSubject</code> object.
            </p>
            <p>Using this DID method has an additional advantage: the DID identifier corresponds to a keypair that is generated during the LEARCredential issuance process, where the private key is generated by the wallet of the employee and it is always under his control.
            </p>
            <p>This private key controlled by the employee can be used to sign challenges from Relying Parties that receive the credential to prove that the person sending the credential is the same person that is identified in the <code>credentialSubject</code> object of the LEARCredential.
            </p>
            <p>It is this property that makes this credential a VerifiableID that can be used for online authentication.
            </p>
            <p>An example DID for the employee could be:
            </p>

<table style="width:100%;"><tbody><tr><td class="codecolor">
<pre class="nohighlight precolor">{
    <span style="color:#000080">"id"</span>: <span style="color:#d14">"did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK"</span>
}</pre></td></tr></tbody></table>

            <p>In this example, the signatures performed with the private key can not be JAdES-compliant ([<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-etsi-jades" title="ETSI TS 119 182-1 V1.1.1 (2021-03) - Electronic Signatures and Infrastructures (ESI); JAdES digital signatures; Part 1: Building blocks and JAdES baseline signatures">ETSI-JADES</a></cite>]), but if the LEARCredential is attached to any other credential that is signed with this private key, then they can be traced up to the eIDAS certificate of the COO and so the chain of responsibility can be determined..
            </p>
            <p>With the DID for the employee, the set of claims identifying him would be then:

            <p>The <code>rolesAndDuties</code> object points to an externally hosted object with the roles and duties of the LEAR. This external object can be either a machine-interpretable definition of the roles and duties in the credential, or just an external definition of the roles and duties in natural language. The ideal approach is the first option, expressing the semantics with a proper machine-readable language, because this will allow automatic access control at the granularity of the individual sentences of that expression language. The <code>rolesAndDuties</code> object can also have the definition embedded into it, instead of having a pointer to an external object.

            <p><b>End user</b>
            </p>
            <p>This profile is valid for both natural and juridical persons, but because we are focusing on the issuance of the LEARCredential, in the detailed examples below we assume a natural person as the user.
            </p>
            <p><b>Wallet</b>
            </p>
            <p>The wallet is assumed to be a Web application with a wallet backend, maybe implemented as a PWA so it has some offline capabilities and can be installed in the device, providing a user experience similar to a native application. Private key management and most sensitive operations are performed in a backend server, operated by an entity trusted by the end user. Other profiles can support native and completely offline PWA mobile applications, for end users.
            </p>
            <p>This type of wallet supports natural persons, juridical persons and natural persons who are legal entity representatives of juridical persons. For juridical persons the wallet is usually called an <code>enterprise wallet</code> but we will use here just the term <code>wallet</code> unless the distinction is required.
            </p>
            <p>In this profile we assume that the wallet is not previously registered with the Issuer and that the wallet does not expose public endpoints that are called by the Issuer, even if the wallet has a backend server that could implement those endpoints. That makes the wallet implementations in this profile to be very similar in interactions to a full mobile implementation, making migration to a full mobile implementation easier.
            </p>
            <p>In other words, from the point of view of the Issuer, the wallet in this profile is almost indistinguishable from a full mobile wallet.
            </p>
            <p><b>User Laptop</b>
            </p>
            <p>For clarity of exposition, we assume in this profile that the End User starts the interactions with the Issuer with an internet browser (user agent) in her laptop. However, there is nothing in the interactions which limits those interactions to a laptop form factor and the End User can interact with any internet browser in any device (mobile, tablet, kiosk).

            <p><b>Issuer</b>
            </p>
            <p>In this profile we assume that the Issuer is composed of two components:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Authorization server</b>: the backend component implementing the existing authentication/authorization functionalities for the Issuer entity.
                </li>
                <li><b>Issuer backend</b>: the main server implementing the business logic as a web application and additional backend APIs required for issuance of credentials.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Issuer backend and the Authorization server could be implemented as a single component in an actual deployment, but we assume here that they are separated to make the profile more general, especially for big entities and also when using Trust Service Providers for cloud signature and credential issuance, for example.
            </p>
            <p><b>Authentication of End User and previous Issuer-End User relationship</b>
            </p>
            <p>We assume that the Issuer and End User have a previous relationship and that the Issuer has performed the KYC required by regulation and needed to be able to issue Verifiable Credentials attesting some attributes about the End User. We assume that there is an existing trusted authentication mechanism (not necessarily related to Verifiable Credentials) that the End User employs to access protected resources from the Issuer. For example, the user is an employee or a customer of the Issuer, or the Issuer is a Local Administration and the End User is a citizen living in that city.

            <p>In this profile the wallet does not have to implement the Credential Offer Endpoint described in section 4 of [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.vci" title="OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance">OpenID.VCI</a></cite>].

            <p>Instead, the Credential Issuer renders a QR code containing a reference to the Credential Offer that can be scanned by the End-User using a Wallet, as described in section 4.1 of [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.vci" title="OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance">OpenID.VCI</a></cite>].
            </p>
            <p>According to the spec, the Credential Offer object is a JSON object containing the Credential Offer parameters and can be sent by value or by reference. To avoid problems with the size of the QR travelling in the URL, this profile requires that the QR contains the <code>credential_offer_uri</code>, which is a URL using the <code>https</code> scheme referencing a resource containing a JSON object with the Credential Offer parameters. The <code>credential_offer_uri</code> endpoint should be implemented by the Issuer backend.

This field is a boolean value specifying whether the Credential Issuer expects presentation of a user PIN along with the Token Request in a Pre-Authorized Code Flow. Default is false.

                    <p>In the example of a LEARCredential, the wallet generates a pair of public/private keys and a <code>did:key</code> identifier which is univocally related to the public key. This is the reason why the <code>kid</code> field above is exactly the DID identifier under this DID method. The <code>did:key</code> method is very simple and achieves a very high degree of privacy, allowing the creation of many different identifiers which can be one-use only if so desired.
                    </p>
                    <p>The <code>did:key</code> method is perfect for the requirements of our usage of the LEARCredential. Any other suitable DID method can be used if it is required, but this is out of scope for this profile.

            <p>Authentication requires a special type of Verifiable Credential called a VerifiableID. For the examples illustrating the mechanism we will use a LEARCredential, which is at the same time a VerifiableId and a Verifiable Authorization.
            </p>
            <p>For the explanation we will use the following figure which is based on <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[NIST-AUTH]]]" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-178.pdf">NIST Special Publication 800-178: A Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Standards for Data Service Applications</a></cite> which describes a reference architecture with necessary functional components to achieve authentication and enforcement of the authorization policies. The authorization process depends on four layers of functionality: <b>Enforcement</b>, <b>Decision</b>, <b>Access Control Data</b>, and <b>Administration</b>.

            <p>The diagram uses the logical concepts also used in the XACML reference architecture, but the description is agnostic to the actual policy language used in a concrete implementation.
            </p>
            <p>In this description we assume that the user is a natural person who wants to access a protected resource. However, the architecture supports machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions. The differences will be described in the description when they are relevant.

            <p>The high level flow is the following:
            </p>
            <ul class="plain">
                <li id="1038.1"><a href="#1038.1" class="selfref"><b>1</b></a> The user sends a request to access a protected resource managed by the Relying Party.

                </li>
                <li id="1040.2"><a href="#1040.2" class="selfref"><b>2</b></a> Every request to a protected resource is intercepted by the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point). The PEP is normally implemented as a reverse proxy or API gateway, so all calls to protected resources entering the organisation are intercepted and forwarded only if they are accepted. If the request does not come with authentication information, there are several high level scenarios which are possible:

                    <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the user is a machine using an API, the request is rejected with an error. The caller is responsible for authenticating before retrying, which can be done using the metadata about the Relying Party available at the standard OpenID endpoints.
                        </li>
                        <li>If the user is a natural person using a browser for navigating the portal of the Relying Party, the typical approach is to redirect the browser to the authentication component using an HTTP Status of 302. The redirection includes enough information so the authentication component can send back the user to the original request if the user completes authentication successfully.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>Alternatively, the request can include authentication information which has been obtained before via an authentication process. If this is the case, the PEP goes directly into the authentication phase, described later in section <a href="#accesscontrol" class="xref">Access control with Verifiable Credentials</a>.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li id="1049.3"><a href="#1049.3" class="selfref"><b>3</b></a> The user is redirected to the authentication component. As mentioned before, alternatively the authorization component can be accessed directly by the user before trying to access the protected resource. This would be the expected behaviour of a user who knows that authentication is required. The mechanism described here supports all possible scenarios both for natural persons and machines.

                    <div>
                    <p>An example flow with a natural person would be: The user navigates first to a general Login page in the portal of the Relying Party and authenticates. After authentication the portal presents a collection of services that the user can access. The user selects one of the services/operations and the Relying Party executes the operation if the user is authorised to do so.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li id="1053.4"><a href="#1053.4" class="selfref"><b>4</b></a> The Verifiable Credentials verifier component of the Relying Party retrieves the credentials that are required for authentication. If the user has been redirected when trying to access a protected resource, the redirection provides information about the operation and protected resource that was trying to access, so there may be more credentials required than just a VerifiableID.

                    <div>
                    <p>If the user accessed the Login page directly, the VC Verifier component does not have information about the resource that the user intends to access, so it can request just a VerifiableID.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li id="1057.5"><a href="#1057.5" class="selfref"><b>5</b></a> The VC Verifier component of the Relying Party and the Wallet of the user engage in a Verifiable Presentation Exchange flow, where the result is that the VC Verifier receives a VerifiableID and possibly additional Verifiable Credentials as determined in step 4.

                </li>
                <li id="1059.6"><a href="#1059.6" class="selfref"><b>6</b></a> The authorization mechanism uses the Trust Framework to query different Trusted Lists that are needed to evaluate the policy rules applicable to the request and compute a decision.

                    <div>
                    <p>The Trust Framework is composed of one or more Trusted Lists where each list is specialised in some specific domain of trust.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>For example, the Trust Framework contains Trusted Lists with the schema definitions used for the well-known types of Verifiable Credentials in the ecosystem. In this way, if the Verifiable Registry used for the Trust Framework is based on a Blockchain network (or several federated networks), the schemas can be published in a trusted and resilient manner reducing the risk of malicious tampering and keeping a record of the history of modifications.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>But the most interesting Trusted Lists in the Trust Framework are the Trusted Issuers Lists, which provide the mechanism to efficiently and securely verify that the issuer of a given credential is a Trusted Issuer of that type of credentials.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>It has to be noticed that even though most Trusted Issuer Lists are global (used by all participants in the ecosystem) and have essentially public information, there may be some specialised lists that are private to one or more organisations and specialised in some specific requirement.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>In this way, there may be some lists that are specific to the products that one organisation provides to other participants in the ecosystem. For example, there may be a Trusted Issuer List private to one organisation which is updated with the identity of a participant when that participant acquires access to some product provided by that organisation.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>For example, this "product-specific" Trusted Issuer List is queried when performing authorization if the related policy rules specify that the issuer of the Verifiable Credential received in the request should have acquired the product that the request is trying to access.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>However, as mentioned before, the set of "internal" and "external" Trusted Lists to query is not hardcoded but it depends on the specific policy rules that should be applied to the request when computing the decision to grant access or not.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>In this way, the system provides a great deal of flexibility on how access control is performed.
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <p>For simplicity, the diagram below shows the query of the Trusted Issuer Lists as a single interaction to a single box, but the actual interactions can be very complex if required. In addition, the diagram does not specify whether the list is "private" or "global".
                    </p>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The following sections elaborate in more detail in each of the interactions.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="starting-the-openid-for-verifiable-presentations-flow"><div class="header-wrapper"><h4 id="x2-4-2-starting-the-openid-for-verifiable-presentations-flow"><bdi class="secno">2.4.2 </bdi>Starting the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow</h4><a class="self-link" href="#starting-the-openid-for-verifiable-presentations-flow" aria-label="Permalink for Section 2.4.2"></a></div>

            <p>In this section we assume that the user tries to access a protected resource and that the user is not authenticated. The flow when the user is already authenticated is the same, just skipping the authentication phase (steps 1 to 6).
            </p>
            <p>The authentication process starts an OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow combined with the Self-Issued OP v2 specification [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.siop2" title="Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2">OpenID.SIOP2</a></cite>], where the VC Verifier component of the portal plays the role of a Relying Party (RP in Open ID Connect terminology) and the wallet of the user is a Self-Issued IdP.
            </p>
            <p>In this step, the Verifier has to send an Authorization Request to the wallet. But as a Self-Issued OP may be running locally as a native application or progressive web application (PWA), the RP may not have a network-addressable endpoint to communicate directly with the OP. We have to leverage the implicit flow of OpenID Connect to communicate with such locally-running Ops, as described in [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="#bib-openid.siop2" title="Self-Issued OpenID Provider v2">OpenID.SIOP2</a></cite>].
            </p>
            <p>We use a QR code to start the process and allow the wallet to receive the Authorization Request from the Verifier, and respond with an Authorization Response, sent to the Verifier in the body of an HTTP <code>POST</code> request.

See section <a href="#request_scope" class="xref">Request Scope</a> for more details. We use in this instance the value <code>dome.credentials.presentation.LEARCredential</code> which means that the RP (DOME onboarding service) is asking the SIOP (user wallet) to send a credential of type <code>LEARCredential</code>.

                <li id="1231.10"><a href="#1231.10" class="selfref"><b>10</b></a> Verification of the signature. As mentioned in the previous section, the Authorization Request is received as a JWT signed by the DOME onboarding service, using the eIDAS certificate for seals that corresponds to the legal person operating the service. This allows the wallet to verify that the signature corresponds to a real-world entity.

                <li id="1234.11"><a href="#1234.11" class="selfref"><b>11</b></a> Verification that the DID in the <code>client_id</code> field of the Authorization Request corresponds to the entity that signed the Authorization Request.

<div>
                    <p>The actual mechanism may vary depending on the DID method used and the ecosystem where the client wants to onboard.
                    </p>
                    <p>If the Relying Party is a well known entity (like the DOME onboarding service in the case of DOME), it is easy to verify that the DID corresponds to the Relying Party.
                    </p>
                    <p>In most other cases, for example when the Relying Party is a participant in the ecosystem, we assume that the ecosystem provides a Trusted Participants Registry with an API compatible with the EBSI Trusted Issuers Registry, and that the participants registry is managed in a trusted way by the onboarding service (meaning that the Wallet user trusts on the onboarding service, in the same way as all other participants).
                    </p>
                    <p>In this case, to check if the DID is a participant on the ecosystem, the wallet sends a <code>GET /api/did/v1/identifiers/{did-to-verify}</code> request to the endpoint of one of several trusted servers implementing the functionality to query the Trusted Participant Registry, where <code>{did-to-verify}</code> is the actual DID the Wallet wants to check (in our example it would be <code>did:elsi:VATFR-99999999</code>, corresponding to the RP) . The API returns a JSON document as a DID Document. The DID Document (as per W3C) contains relevant information about the entity owner of the DID. It contains its Public Key, used to verify the digital signature of the entity. It also contains the status of the entity in the ecosystem. It is extensible and can contain any public information which may be relevant for the use case. The API must be operated by a trusted entity for the Wallet user. There may be as many servers implementing the API as needed and operated by different entities. At least one of those trusted entities has to be configured in the Wallet of the user, to facilitate the use of the wallet.

            <p>This section assumes that authentication has already been performed and that the Relying Party receives a request to a protected resource, with a proper access token inside the request. If the request does not come with an access token, the request is rejected immediately (or the user is redirected to the Authentication service of the Relying Party, depending on the use case).
            </p>
            <p>The Access Control mechanism described here is the same independently of whether the request comes from a user or a machine, so the M2M use case is supported without any modification. In the following description we will use the term <b>user</b> interchangeably for both the user as a natural person or the user as a machine.
            </p>
            <p>However, the assumption is that all machines have an identity (they are assigned an identifier), and that they are acting <code>on behalf of</code> a legally valid identity in the sense of eIDAS2. In other words, we require that the identities of users and machines can be cryptographically bound to the real-world identity of either a natural person or a legal person in a way that provides legal certainty to the Relying Party regarding the chain of responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>If the user is a natural person using the portal of the Relying Party, the request to the protected resource will come from the browser that the user employs to navigate the portal, and the access token will be included automatically by the browser in every request that is sent to the Relying Party, for example when the user clicks a button or fills a form.
            </p>
            <p>If the user is a server or device, it is assumed that it has obtained an access token previously as the result of an authentication process described above. The server or device is responsible for including the access token in every request that is sent to the Relying Party to access a protected resource.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal of the Relying Party is an onboarding process (eg., the portal of the DOME Onboarding service), the protected resource could be the onboarding service itself, or a service to upload additional information for a partially completed onboarding process.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal is a Marketplace and the organisation using the portal wants to offer products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Seller</i>, or to create a Product specification and offering.
            </p>
            <p>If the portal is the Marketplace and the organisation wants to contract products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Customer</i>, or to launch a procurement order of a product.
            </p>
            <p>The same mechanism can be used by any participant in the ecosystem, if they want to use an advanced IAM mechanism which is aligned with the EU strategy on digital identity based on Verifiable Credential and eIDAS2.
            </p>
            <p>For the explanation we will use the following figure which is based on <cite><a data-matched-text="[[[NIST-AUTH]]]" href="https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-178.pdf">NIST Special Publication 800-178: A Comparison of Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) Standards for Data Service Applications</a></cite> which describes a reference architecture with necessary functional components to achieve enforcement the authorization policies. The authorization process depends on four layers of functionality: <b>Enforcement</b>, <b>Decision</b>, <b>Access Control Data</b>, and <b>Administration</b>.

            <p>Every request to a protected resource is intercepted by the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point), and to know if the request should be authorised or not, the PEP asks to the PDP (Policy Decision Point) for a decision. The PDP needs to know what are the policy rules that should be applied to the request, and it uses the PRP (Policy Retrieval Point) to retrieve those policies.

<div>
                    <p>After inspecting the request, the PEP requests a decision from the PDP passing a series of attributes. In general, the request from the PEP to the PDP consists of <b>subject</b> attributes (typically for the user who issued the request), <b>resource</b> attributes (the resource for which access is sought), <b>action</b> attributes (the operations to be performed on the resource), and <b>environment</b> attributes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some of the above attributes are obtained by the PEP from the original request received from the user. For example, the HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and the URL and possibly the body of the request provide action attributes. Specifically, in the case of an NGSI-LD request those attributes are formally specified in the NGSI-LD standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>The subject attributes most relevant for access control are located in the access token received with the request. In particular, the access token includes the Verifiable Credentials that were employed for authentication, and the claims in those credentials can be used to evaluate access control policies. This includes (but is not limited to) the roles object that may be included in the VerifiableID credential used for authentication.

                    <p>Environmental attributes, which depend on the availability of system sensors that can detect and report values, are somewhat different from subject and resource attributes, which are administratively created. Environmental attributes are not properties of the subject or resources, but are measurable characteristics that pertain to the operational or situational context in which access requests occur. These environmental characteristics are subject and resource independent, and may include the current time, day of the week, or threat level.
                    </p>
                    <p>The PDP computes decisions to permit or deny subject requests to perform actions on resources. In computing a decision, the PDP queries policies stored in a PRP (Policy Retrieval Point).
                    </p>
                    <p>If the attributes of the request are not sufficient for rule and policy evaluation, the PDP may need to search the PIP for additional attributes. The PIP is shown as one logical store, but in fact may comprise multiple physical stores of different types.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to the PIP, the PDP uses one or more Trusted Issuers Lists (to check if the issuer of the credential is included in them as a trusted issuer of that type of credential), and also the Authorization Registry (AR), which can check for finer granularity authorisation records which may be very dynamic in nature (e.g. if some resource usage by employees and machines owned by the issuer have exceeded some quota this month).
                    </p>
                    <p>The actual Trusted Issuers Lists that the PDP needs to check is determined by the policy rules retrieved from the PRP. Those policy rules also determine the additional queries performed to the PIP data stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>The set of information and data stored in the PIP and PRP comprise the access control data and collectively define the current authorization state, which the PDP will use to compute its decision.

            <p>After retrieving the policies from the PRP, the PDP determines what are the attributes needed by the policy rules to perform its evaluation. Some of those attributes can be determined from the request received (e.g., claims inside the Verifiable Credential(s) in the access token). But in general, the policy rules require additional attributes that have to be retrieved from other sources.
            </p>
            <p>The two logical sources of those attributes are the PIP and the Trusted Issuers Lists in the Trust Anchor Framework.
            </p>
            <p>The concept of the PIP is the same as in the standard XACML logical architecture, essentially enabling the PDP to retrieve environmental attributes required for policy evaluation.
            </p>
            <p>In our approach using Verifiable Credentials for authentication and authorization, we use a Trust Framework to determine if the credentials received in the request are issued by authorised issuers of those credentials.
            </p>
            <p>The PDP does not have hardcoded the actual Trusted Lists to query, but they are determined dynamically from the policies retrieved from the PRP. In simple use cases there may be one or two lists to query which are the same for all requests. But the mechanism described here can cater for very complex scenarios where the lists may be different depending on the requests and also from the dynamic environmental information retrieved from the PIP.

            <p>The authorization mechanism uses the Trust Framework to query different Trusted Lists that are needed to evaluate the policy rules applicable to the request and compute a decision.
            </p>
            <p>The Trust Framework is composed of one or more Trusted Lists where each list is specialised in some specific domain of trust.
            </p>
            <p>For example, the Trust Framework contains Trusted Lists with the schema definitions used for the well-known types of Verifiable Credentials in the ecosystem. In this way, if the Verifiable Registry used for the Trust Framework is based on a Blockchain network (or several federated networks), the schemas can be published in a trusted and resilient manner reducing the risk of malicious tampering and keeping a record of the history of modifications.
            </p>
            <p>But the most interesting Trusted Lists in the Trust Framework are the Trusted Issuers Lists, which provide the mechanism to efficiently and securely verify that the issuer of a given credential is a Trusted Issuer of that type of credentials.
            </p>
            <p>It has to be noticed that even though most Trusted Issuer Lists are global (used by all participants in the ecosystem) and have essentially public information, there may be some specialised lists that are private to one or more organisations and specialised in some specific requirement.
            </p>
            <p>In this way, there may be some lists that are specific to the products that one organisation provides to other participants in the ecosystem. For example, there may be a Trusted Issuer List private to one organisation which is updated with the identity of a participant when that participant acquires access to some product provided by that organisation.
            </p>
            <p>For example, this "product-specific" Trusted Issuer List is queried when performing authorization if the related policy rules specify that the issuer of the Verifiable Credential received in the request should have acquired the product that the request is trying to access.
            </p>
            <p>However, as mentioned before, the set of "internal" and "external" Trusted Lists to query is not hardcoded but it depends on the specific policy rules that should be applied to the request when computing the decision to grant access or not.
            </p>
            <p>In this way, the system provides a great deal of flexibility on how access control is performed.
            </p>

    </p>
    <p>RealTruth is a Trust Service Provider operating under the eIDAS Trust Framework, which issues a certificate for seals to the company GoodAir. GoodAir is a business that provides some services using an Air Quality application operated by GoodAir.
    </p>
    <p>RealTruth also provides a certificate for signatures to the COO of the GoodAir company, so the COO can use the certificate to sign documents on behalf of GoodAir (like contracts, invoices, financial reports, ...) in a way that is compliant with eIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>The COO of GoodAir will issue a verifiable credential of type LEARCredential to an employee of GoodAir, signing the credential with his certificate for signatures.

        <p>The new participant is a business providing an Air Quality Monitoring application as a service. The business is called GoodAir and it operates the application, which receives data from a set of sensors that may or may not be the property of GoodAir. The sensors must have received a certification to be able to operate and send data to the GoodAir application.

        <p>The GoodAir company is small and the only person that can sign contracts on behalf of the company is the COO (Chief Operating Officer). The COO is a legal representative of the company and she is registered as so in the business registry of Spain.
        </p>
        <p>The COO has a certificate for electronic signatures issued by one of the TSPs in Spain enabling the COO to perform electronic qualified signatures as legal representative of GoodAir, instead of doing them manually.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before issuing a certificate like the above, the TSP has to perform some validations to ensure that in the official source of truth (the business registry of Spain in this case) there is already registered information that states that the COO has indeed powers to act on behalf of GoodAir as a legal representative.

            <p>Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI are required to provide interfaces to Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes  (QEAA) Providers to verify the authenticity of the above attributes, either directly or via designated intermediaries recognised at national level.
            </p>
            <p>Authentic Sources may also issue (Q)EAA-s themselves if they meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. It is up to the Member States to define terms and conditions for the provisioning of these services, but according to the minimum technical specifications, standards, and procedures applicable to the verification procedures for qualified electronic attestations of attributes.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In accordance to the policies, RealTruth made those validations when issuing the certificate to the COO, in such a way that the Relying Parties verifying the certificate can have a high level of trust in the assertion that the natural person identified in the certificate (with Spanish ID of 56565656V) is a legal representative of he GoodAir company (organizationIdentifier VATES-12345678).

        <p>DOME is a Data Space where local governments can procure data and services from other entities that act as service providers. At the same time, the local governments can also act as data and service providers for other entities in the Data Space.
        </p>
        <p>The DOME Data Space has an portal service that allows external entities to perform some processes in an automated fashion by using Verifiable Credentials that have been issued by trusted entities. The complete Trust Framework used by DOME is composed from a series of Trust Frameworks, some managed internally using a governance model of DOME and some others managed externally but by trusted entities. At the root of the Trust Framework of DOME is the eIDAS Trust Framework and the pan-european recognized list of Trust Service Providers issuing the eIDAS compliant digital identities, in the form of certificates for signatures/seals.
        </p>
        <p>In order to participate in DOME, every legal person requires a certificate for seals or that one of its legal representatives has a certificate for signatures (or both). The DOME entity is registered in France with VAT number <b>VATFR-99999999</b>.

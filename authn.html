<section><h2>Introduction
</h2>

    <p>Once an organisation has onboarded an ecosystem like a Data Space, some of its employees have to be appointed to enable them to perform a concrete set of activities in the ecosystem. These activities are performed in the web portals of different organisations which are already participants in the ecosystem, like the onboarding service, the marketplace portals and also in the web portals of other participants.

    </p>
    <p>This document describes:

    </p>
    <ul>

        <li>How an organisation can issue Verifiable Credentials to its employees enabling them to perform some specific processes in other organisations "on-behalf-of" the employer, in a way which is compatible with eIDAS and so it provides a legal certainty and non-repudiation levels equivalent to signed documents typically used for those tasks.

        </li>
        <li>How other organisations can accept those Verifiable Credentials to perform authentication and access control, leveraging the eIDAS legal framework to obtain the same levels of legal certainty and non-repudiation as when using other traditional forms of documentation.

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The mechanisms described here can also be used when the users involved are not strictly employees, but it also works for contractors. It also can be used for customers of the organisation, except the issuance process is probably a little bit different and the roles and duties embedded in the credentials have different legal implications (but always in line with the legal framework, for example with the Consumer Protection Directive).

    </p>
    <p>For clarity of the exposition, we focus in this document on the employee use case, and later we generalise to other types of end-users, including machines and devices acting on behalf of an organisation.

    </p>
    <p>At a high level, we want to enable the use of Verifiable Credentials so that when an entity (a legal person or a natural person acting on behalf of a legal person) wants to perform an action on a protected resource managed by a Relying Party, we use Verifiable Credentials to perform authentication of the entity and then access control based on the content of the Verifiable Credential(s) presented by that entity, and possibly additional authorisation information that the Relying Party considers relevant for controlling access to the protected resource (for example, the contractual status of the resource, time of the day or other context information).

    </p>
    <section><h2>Authentication requires a VerifiableID
</h2>

        <p>Not all types of Verifiable Credentials can be used as a mechanism for online authentication, because the Relying Party (the entity receiving the Verifiable Credential in an authentication process) needs to bind the identity of the user sending the credential to the claims attested about the subject inside the credential.

        </p>
        <p>For the purpose of this discussion we use a diagram derived from the taxonomy <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/EBSIDOC/Data+Models+and+Schemas">defined in EBSI</a>:

        </p>
        <figure><img src='builtassets/diagram_305c81c1bd87a8e5efb039f7ee33ee41.png' alt=''>
        <figcaption>A credential as a VerifiableID
</figcaption></figure>

        <p>For example, in the case of a Diploma as a Verifiable Credential (a Verifiable Diploma), the credential is a Verifiable Attestation which indicates that the subject has certain skills or has achieved certain learning outcomes through formal or non-formal learning context. However, as in the case with normal Diplomas in paper of PDF format, this credential can be presented by anyone that holds the credential. In other words, the credential binds the identity of the subject with the claims inside the credential, but does not bind the identity of the holder of the credential with the identity of the subject of the credential, which requires a special mechanism in the issuance process.

        </p>
        <p>Most Verifiable Credentials will be issued as Verifiable Attestations, acting as efficient machine-processable and verifiable equivalent to their analog counterparts. Their purpose is to attest some attributes about the subject of the credential and not act as a mechanism for online authentication.

        </p>
        <p>Instead, <b>a <code>VerifiableID</code> is a special form of a Verifiable Credential that a natural or legal person can use in an electronic identification process as evidence of whom he/she/it is</b> (comparable with a passport, physical IDcard, driving licence, social security card, member-card…).

        </p>
        <p>VerifiableIDs can be of different types and be issued by different entities with different levels of assurance (in eIDAS terminology). They are issued with the purpose of serving as authentication mechanisms in online processes. In the near future, VerifiableIDs of the highest level of assurance (LoA High) will be issued to citizens and businesses by their governments under eIDAS2.

        </p>
        <p>We describe in this document a way to issue VerifiableID credentials and how a Relying Party can perform authentication by accepting that credential.

        </p>
    </section>
    <section><h2>Access Control requires a Verifiable Authorisation
</h2>

        <p>In general, in an authentication and access control process, the entity willing to perform an action on a protected resource has to present (in a Verifiable Presentation) a VerifiableID and possibly one or more additional Verifiable Attestations.

        </p>
        <p>The credential should include identifying the employee (or any other subject) and a formal description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation.

        </p>

    <section><h2>LEARCredential is both a VerifiableID and Verifiable Authorisation
</h2>

        <p>In many use cases, it is possible to simplify the authentication and access control by combining in a single credential both a VerifiableID (authentication) and a Verifiable Authorisation (for access control).

        </p>
        <p>The resulting credential is called LEARCredential and it is very useful when the holder/subject wants to use decentralised IAM mechanisms implemented by Relying Parties which are federated in a decentralised way using a common Trust Anchor Framework.

        </p>
        <p>The concept of LEARCredential is described in the following diagram:

        </p>
        <figure><img src='builtassets/diagram_fbbeb7b4ff0898bcce0f78ae0e543ce5.png' alt=''>
        <figcaption>The LEARCredential is both a Verifiable Authorisation and a VerifiableID
</figcaption></figure>

        <p>The appointed employee will perform the process by using a special type of Verifiable Credential called <code>LEARCredential</code> (from <b>L</b>egal <b>E</b>ntity <b>A</b>ppointed <b>R</b>epresentative).

        </p>
        <p>To achieve a high level of legal certainty under eIDAS, the LEARCredential is:

        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>signed or sealed with an eIDAS certificate which is either:

                <div>
                <ul>

                    <li>a <b>certificate for electronic seals</b> issued to a legal person by a Qualified Trust Service Provider, or

                    </li>
                    <li>a <b>certificate for electronic signatures</b>, issued to a <b>legal representative of the legal person</b> by a Qualified Trust Service Provider.

                    </li>
                </ul>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>signed using the <b>JSON Advanced Electronic Signature</b> format described in [[[ETSI-JADES]]]

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The LEARCredential includes claims identifying the employee and a description of the concrete powers that have been delegated by the legal representative of the organisation.

        </p>
        <p>By signing/sealing the credential with an eIDAS certificate, the legal representative attests that the powers described in the credential have been delegated to the employee (maybe under some conditions, also described in the credential).

        </p>
        <p>In this way, the LEARCredential has the same legal status as any other document in other formats (e.g., PDF) signed in an eIDAS-compliant way, but with all the advantages provided by the Verifiable Credential format.

        </p>
        <p>In addition, the LEARCredential includes cryptographic material that allows the appointed employee to <b>use the credential as an online authentication mechanism</b> in a portal, by proving that the holder of the credential is the same person identified in the credential.

        </p>
        <p>Any Verifier that trusts the eIDAS Trust Framework will be able to verify that:

        </p>
        <ul>

            <li><b>The person presenting the LEARCredential is the same as the one identified in the credential</b>

            </li>
            <li><b>A legal representative of the organisation has attested that the person has the powers described in the credential</b>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This enables the person presenting the LEARCredential to start the process and to provide any additional required documentation, preferably as additional Verifiable Credentials to enable automatic verification of compliance with the process requirements (including Gaia-X credentials issued by the Compliance Service of Gaia-X). 

        </p>
        <p>Both types of eIDAS certificates mentioned above are an electronic attestation <b>that links electronic seal/signature validation data to a legal person and confirms the name of that person</b>. This way, the certificate, usually linked to the sealed/signed document, can be used to verify the identity of the creator of the seal/signature and whether the document has been sealed/signed using the corresponding private key.

        </p>
        <p>Before issuing a certificate like the above, the Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP) performs validations against `Authentic Sources` to authenticate the identity of the organisation:

        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>The data concerning the business name or corporate name of the organisation.

            </li>
            <li>The data relating to the constitution and legal status of the subscriber.

            </li>
            <li>The data concerning the extent and validity of the powers of representation of the applicant.

            </li>
            <li>The data concerning the tax identification code of the organisation or equivalent code used in the country to whose legislation the subscriber is subject.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The person controlling the above certificates will appoint a legal entity representative (LEAR) by generating and signing a Verifiable Credential which:

        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>Includes identification data of an employee of the organisation

            </li>
            <li>Includes claims stating the delegation of specific powers to perform a set of specific processes on behalf of the organisation

            </li>
            <li>Includes a public key where the corresponding private key is controlled by the employee, enabling him to prove that he is the holder of the credential when it is being used in an authentication process like the ones used as examples in this document.

            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The LEARCredential uses the `did:elsi` method for the identifiers of legal persons involved in the process, to facilitate the DID resolution and linkage with the eIDAS certificates. The `did:elsi` method is specified in [[[DID-ELSI]]].    

        </p>
        <p>The high-level view of the process is described in the following diagram, when a COO (Chief Operating Officer) appoints an employee to perform some processes:

        </p>

        <figcaption>High level view of issuance of LEARCredential
</figcaption></figure>

    </section>
    <section><h2>The LEARCredential for some identification processes
</h2>

        <p>But <b>any entity can issue VerifiableIDs</b>, though the acceptance by Relying Parties can not be ensured because it is the Relying Party the only one deciding if it trusts on the issuer and its process for generating the VerifiableID.

        </p>
        <p>DOME will make use of the future eIDAS2 VerifiableIDs when they are available and when they make sense in the context of DOME. But DOME defines some specific types of VerifiableIDs that are derived from eIDAS certificates for signatures/seals using the regulated standards for signatures, achieving a level of assurance that provides an acceptable level of legal certainty and reduced risk of repudiation.

        </p>
        <p>An example is the LEARCredential described in a section above, which has the same level of legal certainty as any document signed with the same certificates (like a contract or an invoice).

        </p>
        <p>Similarly, a Product provider (like GoodAir) who decides to use the DOME Trust and IAM framework or a compatible one for managing access to associated services by customers of their products will typically define specific types of VerifiableIDs if the standard ones in DOME or the existing and widely accepted ones are not suitable for the provider. In general, if a provider can use an existing and already used VerifiableID then it will facilitate potential customers access to its product because issuers of the VerifiableID do not have to modify or adapt their existing issuing processes.

        </p>
    </section>
</section>
<section><h2>The LEARCredential
</h2>

    <p>We use here a LEARCredential, described in detail in [[DID-ONBOARDING]], with different roles and duties embedded into the credential. The credential enables the employee (or subcontractor) to perform a specific sets of processes in the ecosystem, including interacting with other organisations in the ecosystem.

    </p>
    <p>We describe here the differences with respect to the example presented in [[DID-ONBOARDING]], to show how organisations can use LEARCredentials to enable secure, efficient, scalable and decentralised IAM (Identity and Access Management) to enable access to protected resources.

    </p>
    <p>The process of generation of the credential is the same, where the legal representative of the organisation will use his eIDAS certificate to sign the credential.

    </p>
    <p>The credential will be generated with an application that the COO will use as VC Issuer and that allows the employee to receive the credential using his credential wallet, using [[OpenID.VCI]] to achieve compliance with the EUDI Wallet ARF.

    </p>
    <p>The application enables the COO to specify the information required to create the LEARCredential, specifying the employee information and the specific type of LEARCredential. In general, there may be different instances of LEARCredentials for different purposes. One employee can have more than one LEARCredential, each having a different delegation of powers for different environments.

    </p>
    <section><h2>Claims identifying the employee
</h2>

        <p>These are claims identifying the subject of the credential, the person who will act as LEAR. Each Data Space can define their own depending on their specific requirements.

        </p>
        <p>In addition, each organisation can specify their own for enabling access to its products/services. However, it is advisable to do this only when it is strictly required, and it is recommended to use a set of claims that are agreed upon by all participants in the ecosystem. This includes not only the amount of claims but also their syntax and semantics.

        </p>
        <p>An example set of claims is the following:

        </p>

        <p>In this description we assume that the user is a natural person who wants to access a protected resource. However, the architecture support machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions. The differences will be described in the description when they are relevant.

        <figcaption>Architecture overview 
</figcaption></figure>
        <p>We assume here that the user sends a request to perform a protected operation, which we define as any operation that requires authorisation.

        </p>
        <p>An example is an operation on resources controlled by Company A, where Company A allows a subset of employees of Company B to perform the operation. Another similar example is when Company A allows a subset of machines/devices of Company B to perform the operation.

        </p>
        <p>There are several high level scenarios which are possible:

        </p>
        <ul>

            <li>The user navigates first to a general Login page in the portal of the Relying Party and authenticates. After authentication the portal presents a collection of services that the user can access. The user selects one of the services/operations and the Relying Party executes the operation if the user is authorised to do so.

            </li>
            <li>The user tries to access the protected resource directly (maybe using a specific URL, or invoking and endpoint with input data identifying the resource).

                <div>
                <p>If the user is not authenticated, the system will reject the request. If the user is a natural person accessing the portal via an Internet browser, the typical approach is to redirect the browser to the Login page using an HTTP Status of 302. The redirection includes enough information so the authentication component can send back the user to the original request if the user completes authentication successfully.

                </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                <p>If the user is a machine using an API, the system can simply reject the request or reject it including information in the response that the caller can interpret to perform the login and retry.

                </p>
                </div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section><h2>Starting the OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow
</h2>

        <p>In this section we assume that the user tries to access a protected resource and that the user is not authenticated. The flow when the user is already authenticated is the same, just skipping the authentication phase (steps 1 to 6).

        </p>
        <p>The authentication process starts an OpenID for Verifiable Presentations flow combined with the Self-Issued OP v2 specification [[OpenID.SIOP2]], where the VC Verifier component of the portal plays the role of a Relying Party (RP in Open ID Connect terminology) and the wallet of the user is a Self-Issued IdP.

        </p>
        <p>In this step, the Verifier has to send an Authorization Request to the wallet. But as a Self-Issued OP may be running locally as a native application or progressive web application (PWA), the RP may not have a network-addressable endpoint to communicate directly with the OP. We have to leverage the implicit flow of OpenID Connect to communicate with such locally-running Ops, as described in [[OpenID.SIOP2]].

        </p>
        <p>We use a QR code to start the process and allow the wallet to receive the Authorization Request from the Verifier, and respond with an Authorization Response, sent to the Verifier in the body of an HTTP <code>POST</code> request.

        </p>

</h2>

        <p>The Authorization Request travels in the response body of the HTTP GET request performed in the previous point, as a JWT signed by the DOME onboarding service, using the eIDAS certificate for seals that corresponds to the legal person operating the service and with the JAdES signature format.

        </p>
        <p>The parameters comprising a request for verifiable presentations are given in section 5 of [[OpenID.VP]] and in section 10.1 of [[OpenID.SIOP2]] and are reproduced here with the particularities of this use case, in particular taking into account that this is a cross-device interaction:

        </p>
        <ul>

            <li id='653.response_type'><a href='#653.response_type' class='selfref'><b>response_type</b></a> (REQUIRED). Must be <code>vp_token</code>. This parameter is defined in [[RFC6749]]. The possible values are determined by the response type registry established by [[RFC6749]]. The [[OpenID.VP]] specification introduces the response type <code>vp_token</code>. This response type asks the Wallet to return only a VP Token in the Authorization Response, which is what we want in our case.


            </li>
            <li id='655.scope'><a href='#655.scope' class='selfref'><b>scope</b></a> (REQUIRED). This parameter is defined in [[RFC6749]] which allows it to be used by verifiers to request presentation of credentials by utilizing a pre-defined scope value designating the type of credential. See section <a href="#request_scope" class="xref">Request Scope
</a> for more details. We use in this instance the value <code>dome.credentials.presentation.LEARCredential</code> which means that the RP (DOME onboarding service) is asking the SIOP (user wallet) to send a credential of type <code>LEARCredential</code>.


            </li>
            <li id='657.response_mode'><a href='#657.response_mode' class='selfref'><b>response_mode</b></a> REQUIRED. MUST be <code>direct_post</code>. As this is a cross-device scenario, this response mode is used to instruct the Self-Issued OP to deliver the result of the authentication process to a certain endpoint using the HTTP POST method. This endpoint to which the SIOP shall deliver the authentication result is conveyed in the parameter <code>redirect_uri</code> described below.


            </li>
            <li id='659.redirect_uri'><a href='#659.redirect_uri' class='selfref'><b>redirect_uri</b></a> (REQUIRED). MUST be a valid RP endpoint. The Authentication Response is sent to this endpoint using <code>POST</code> and encoding `application/json`).


            </li>
            <li id='661.client_id'><a href='#661.client_id' class='selfref'><b>client_id</b></a> REQUIRED. MUST be the DID of the RP (DOM onboarding entity) so it can be resolved by the SIOP and checked against a Trusted List, or rejected if it does not pass validation. This provides a high level of assurance to the SIOP that the RP is really who it claims.


            </li>
            <li id='663.client_id_scheme'><a href='#663.client_id_scheme' class='selfref'><b>client_id_scheme</b></a> REQUIRED. MUST have the value <code>did</code>. This value indicates that the Client Identifier is a DID defined in [[DID-Core]]. The request MUST be signed with a private key associated with the DID. To obtain the corresponding private key, the Wallet MUST use DID Resolution defined by the DID method used by the Verifier. For most DID methods and since the associated DID Document may include multiple public keys, a particular public key used to sign the request in question MUST be identified by the kid in the JOSE Header. However, in our case the Verifier uses `did:elsi` and so the request MUST be signed with the eIDAS certificate according to the [[ETSI-JADES]] format, which defines the mechanism to identify the public key.


                <div>
                <p>All Verifier metadata other than the public key MUST be obtained from the client_metadata or the `client_metadata_uri parameter` as defined in Section 5 of [[OpenID.VP]].

                </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li id='667.nonce'><a href='#667.nonce' class='selfref'><b>nonce</b></a> REQUIRED. This parameter follows the definition given in [[OpenID.Core]]. It is used to securely bind the verifiable presentation(s) provided by the wallet (SIOP) to the particular transaction managed by the RP.


            </li>
            <li id='669.state'><a href='#669.state' class='selfref'><b>state</b></a> REQUIRED. Used by the portal component of DOM onboarding to associate the start of an authentication session with the end of that session when the RP Verifier component notifies to the portal.


            </li>
            <li id='671.presentation_definition'><a href='#671.presentation_definition' class='selfref'><b>presentation_definition</b></a> CONDITIONAL. A string containing a <code>presentation_definition</code> JSON object as defined in Section 4 of [[DIF.PresentationExchange]]. We do not use this parameter because <code>scope</code> already specifies the credential type.


            </li>
            <li id='673.presentation_definition_uri'><a href='#673.presentation_definition_uri' class='selfref'><b>presentation_definition_uri</b></a> CONDITIONAL. A string containing a URL pointing to a resource where a <code>presentation_definition</code> JSON object as defined in Section 4 of [[DIF.PresentationExchange]] can be retrieved. We do not use this parameter because <code>scope</code> already specifies the credential type.


            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Note: A request MUST contain either a <code>presentation_definition</code> or a <code>presentation_definition_uri</code> or a single <code>scope</code> value representing a presentation definition, those three ways to request credential presentation are mutually exclusive. We use here the <code>scope</code> mechanism, which is simpler and fits our use case.

        <p>Where the claims <code>iss</code> and <code>sub</code> MUST be the DID of the RP (in this case DOME onboarding) and MUST correspond exactly with the <code>client_id</code> parameter in the Authorization Request. The claim <code>auth_request</code> contains the Authentication Request as a string. The expiration time in claim <code>exp</code> avoids replays and can be very short because it is used by the Wallet just on reception of the Authentication Request. The expiration time should be enough for the user to review the Authorization Request, decide the credential(s) to send to the RP and instruct the Wallet to send the Authorization Reply to the RP.

As mentioned in the previous section, the Authorization Request is received as a JWT signed by the DOME onboarding service, using the eIDAS certificate for seals that corresponds to the legal person operating the service. This allows the wallet to verify that the signature corresponds to a real-world entity.

</div>
            </li>
            <li id='735.12'><a href='#735.12' class='selfref'><b>12</b></a> Verification that the entity identified in the `client_id` field of the Authorization Request is a trusted entity belonging to the ecosystem, by resolving the DID in the `client_id` field.

<div>
                <p>The actual mechanism may vary depending on the DID method used and the ecosystem where the client wants to onboard.

                </p>
                <p>If the Relying Party is a well known entity (like the DOME onboarding service in the case of DOME), it is easy to verify that the DID corresponds to the Relying Party.

                </p>
                <p>In most other cases, for example when the Relying Party is a participant in the ecosystem, we assume that the ecosystem provides a Trusted Participants Registry with an API compatible with the EBSI Trusted Issuers Registry, and that the participants registry is managed in a trusted way by the onboarding service (meaning that the Wallet user trusts on the onboarding service, in the same way as all other participants).

                </p>
                <p>In this case, to check if the DID is a participant on the ecosystem, the wallet sends a `GET /api/did/v1/identifiers/{did-to-verify}` request to the endpoint of one of several trusted servers implementing the functionality to query the Trusted Participant Registry, where `{did-to-verify}` is the actual DID the Wallet wants to check (in our example it would be `did:elsi:VATFR-99999999`, corresponding to the RP) . The API returns a JSON document as a DID Document. The DID Document (as per W3C) contains relevant information about the entity owner of the DID. It contains its Public Key, used to verify the digital signature of the entity. It also contains the status of the entity in the ecosystem. It is extensible and can contain any public information which may be relevant for the use case. The API must be operated by a trusted entity for the Wallet user. There may be as many servers implementing the API as needed and operated by different entities. At least one of those trusted entities has to be configured in the Wallet of the user, to facilitate the use of the wallet.

    <section><h2>Authenticating the user with the LEARCredential
</h2>

        <p>We should remember that inside the LEARCredential the <code>credentialSubject</code> object has an <code>id</code> field with value `did:key:z6MkhaXgBZDvotDkL5257faiztiGiC2QtKLGpbnnEGta2doK` which is the DID of the user. It was generated during the creation of the LEARCredential, and the Relying Party should trust that the credential was generated in the proper way binding cryptographically the DID with the LEARCredential, as described in a previous section. It is the same trust that should be put in the generation of any other signed document, like a contract or invoice.

        </p>
        <p>The process of verifying the Authorization Response and authenticating the user with the LEARCredential is the following:

            <li id='832.15_and_16'><a href='#832.15_and_16' class='selfref'><b>15 and 16</b></a> The Verifier receives the Authorization Request and has to perform verifications, the standard ones being defined in [[DIF.PresentationExchange]]. In order to verify that the Verifiable Credential has been issued by a trusted entity, the Relying Party has to verify:

<div>
                <ol>

                    <li>That the DID of the entity which is the issuer of the VC is a trusted entity.

                    </li>
                    <li>That the VC was signed by that participant.

                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Both verifications can be done by performing DID resolution, checking that the resulting DID Document contains the public key corresponding to the one specified in the Verifiable Credential, and by verifying the digital signature of the credential against that public key.

                </p>
                <p>In our case the LEARCredential was issued using the `did:elsi` method, so resolution is very simple and is specified in [[DID-ELSI]].

            </li>
            <li id='843.17'><a href='#843.17' class='selfref'><b>17</b></a> After verifying the credential, the Relying Party can also verify that the Verifiable Presentation including the Verifiable Credential is sent by the user and not by a malicious agent. To do so, it uses the public key associated to the `did:key` identifier `id` field inside the `credentialSubject` structure. That public key is cryptographically bound to the customer DID during the onboarding process that GoodAir performed with its employee.

The Access Token is generated in JWT format and signed by the VC Verifier. The access token is intended for use as bearer token over HTTP [[RFC2616]] using Transport Layer Security (TLS) [[RFC5246]] to access protected resources, and it should use the JWT Profile profile described in [[RFC9068]].

<section><h2>Access control with the LEARCredential
</h2>

    <section><h2>Overview
</h2>

        <p>This section assumes that authentication has already been performed and that the Relying Party receives a request to a protected resource, with a proper access token inside the request. If the request does not come with an access token, the request is rejected immediately (or the user is redirected to the Authentication service of the Relying Party, depending on the use case).

        </p>
        <p>The Access Control mechanism described here is the same independently of whether the request comes from a user or a machine, so the M2M use case is supported without any modification. In the following description we will use the term <code>user</code> interchangeably for both the user as a natural person or the user as a machine.

        </p>
        <p>However, the assumption is that all machines have an identity (they are assigned an identifier), and that they are acting `on behalf of` a legally valid identity in the sense of eIDAS2. In other words, we require that the identities of users and machines can be cryptographically bound to the real-world identity of either a natural person or a legal person in a way that provides legal certainty to the Relying Party regarding the chain of responsibility.

        </p>
        <p>If the user is a natural person using the portal of the Relying Party, the request to the protected resource will come from the browser that the user employs to navigate the portal, and the access token will be included automatically by the browser in every request that is sent ot the Relying Party, for example when the user clicks a button or fills a form.

        </p>
        <p>If the user is a server or device, it is assumed that it has obtained an access token previously as the result of an authentication process described above. The server or device is responsible for including the access token in every request that is sent to the Relying Party to access a protected resource.

        </p>
        <p>If the portal of the Relying Party is an onboarding process (eg., the portal of the DOME Onboarding service), the protected resource could be the onboarding service itself, or a service to upload additional information for a partially completed onboarding process.

        </p>
        <p>If the portal is a Marketplace and the organisation using the portal wants to offer products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Seller</i>, or to create a Product specification and offering.

        </p>
        <p>If the portal is the Marketplace and the organisation wants to contract products in it, these services could be to register the organisation as a <i>Customer</i>, or to launch a procurement order of a product.

        </p>
        <p>The same mechanism can be used by any participant in the ecosystem, if they want to use an advanced IAM mechanism which is aligned with the EU strategy on digital identity based on Verifiable Credential and eIDAS2.

        </p>
        <p>For the explanation we will use the following figure which is based on [[[NIST-AUTH]]] which describes a reference architecture with necessary functional components to achieve enforcement the authorization policies. The authorization process depends on four layers of functionality: <b>Enforcement</b>, <b>Decision</b>, <b>Access Control Data</b>, and <b>Administration</b>.

    </section>
    <section><h2>Determine the Authorization Policies which apply to the request 
</h2>

        <p>Every request to a protected resource is intercepted by the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point), and to know if the request should be authorised or not, the PEP asks to the PDP (Policy Decision Point) for a decision. The PDP needs to know what are the policy rules that should be applied to the request, and it uses the PRP (Policy Retrieval Point) to retrieve those policies.

        <ul class='plain'>
            <li id='954.1'><a href='#954.1' class='selfref'><b>1</b></a> The user (natural person or machine) sends a request to access a protected resource, and the PEP (Policy Enforcement Point) component intercepts the call. The PEP is normally implemented as a reverse proxy or API gateway, so all calls to protected resources entering the organisation are intercepted and forwarded if they are accepted.

<div>
</div>
            </li>
            <li id='957.2'><a href='#957.2' class='selfref'><b>2</b></a> If the request is not authenticated it is rejected with an error. Depending on the use case, the error returned can contain additional information that enables the user agent to be redirected to perform authentication.

<div>
                <p>After inspecting the request, the PEP requests a decision from the PDP passing a series of attributes. In general, the request from the PEP to the PDP consists of <b>subject</b> attributes (typically for the user who issued the request), <b>resource</b> attributes (the resource for which access is sought), <b>action</b> attributes (the operations to be performed on the resource), and <b>environment</b> attributes.

                </p>
                <p>Some of the above attributes are obtained by the PEP from the original request received from the user. For example, the HTTP verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and the URL and possibly the body of the request provide action attributes. Specifically, in the case of an NGSI-LD request those attributes are formally specified in the NGSI-LD standard.

                </p>
                <p>The subject attributes most relevant for access control are located in the access token received with the request. In particular, the access token includes the Verifiable Credentials that were employed for authentication, and the claims in those credentials can be used to evaluate access control policies. This includes (but is not limited to) the roles object that may be included in the VerifiableID credential used for authentication.

                </p>
                <p>An example access token would be:

                <p>The PDP computes decisions to permit or deny subject requests to perform actions on resources. In computing a decision, the PDP queries policies stored in a PRP (Policy Retrieval Point).

                </p>
                <p>If the attributes of the request are not sufficient for rule and policy evaluation, the PDP may need to search the PIP for additional attributes. The PIP is shown as one logical store, but in fact may comprise multiple physical stores of different types.

                </p>
                <p>In addition to the PIP, the PDP uses one or more Trusted Issuers Lists (to check if the issuer of the credential is included in them as a trusted issuer of that type of credential), and also the Authorization Registry (AR), which can check for finer granularity authorisation records which may be very dynamic in nature (e.g. if some resource usage by employees and machines owned by the issuer have exceeded some quota this month).

                </p>
                <p>The actual Trusted Issuers Lists that the PDP needs to check is determined by the policy rules retrieved from the PRP. Those policy rules also determine the additional queries performed to the PIP data stores.

                </p>
                <p>The set of information and data stored in the PIP and PRP comprise the access control data and collectively define the current authorization state, which the PDP will use to compute its decision.

    <section><h2>Determine which Trusted Issuer Lists should be queried
</h2>

        <p>After retrieving the policies from the PRP, the PDP determines what are the attributes needed by the policy rules to perform its evaluation. Some of those attributes can be determined from the request received (e.g., claims inside the Verifiable Credential(s) in the access token). But in general, the policy rules require additional attributes that have to be retrieved from other sources.

        </p>
        <p>The two logical sources of those attributes are the PIP and the Trusted Issuers Lists in the Trust Anchor Framework.

        </p>
        <p>The concept of the PIP is the same as in the standard XACML logical architecture, essentially enabling the PDP to retrieve environmental attributes required for policy evaluation.

        </p>
        <p>In our approach using Verifiable Credentials for authentication and authorization, we use a Trust Framework to determine if the credentials received in the request are issued by authorised issuers of those credentials.

        </p>
        <p>The PDP does not have hardcoded the actual Trusted Lists to query, but they are determined dynamically from the policies retrieved from the PRP. In simple use cases there may be one or two lists to query which are the same for all requests. But the mechanism described here can cater for very complex scenarios where the lists may be different depending on the requests and also from the dynamic environmental information retrieved from the PIP.

    <section><h2>Query the Trusted Issuer Lists
</h2>

        <p>The authorization mechanism uses the Trust Framework to query different Trusted Lists that are needed to evaluate the policy rules applicable to the request and compute a decision.

        </p>
        <p>The Trust Framework is composed of one or more Trusted Lists where each list is specialised in some specific domain of trust.

        </p>
        <p>For example, the Trust Framework contains Trusted Lists with the schema definitions used for the well-known types of Verifiable Credentials in the ecosystem. In this way, if the Verifiable Registry used for the Trust Framework is based on a Blockchain network (or several federated networks), the schemas can be published in a trusted and resilient manner reducing the risk of malicious tampering and keeping a record of the history of modifications.

        </p>
        <p>But the most interesting Trusted Lists in the Trust Framework are the Trusted Issuers Lists, which provide the mechanism to efficiently and securely verify that the issuer of a given credential is a Trusted Issuer of that type of credentials.

        </p>
        <p>It has to be noticed that even though most Trusted Issuer Lists are global (used by all participants in the ecosystem) and have essentially public information, there may be some specialised lists that are private to one or more organisations and specialised in some specific requirement.

        </p>
        <p>In this way, there may be some lists that are specific to the products that one organisation provides to other participants in the ecosystem. For example, there may be a Trusted Issuer List private to one organisation which is updated with the identity of a participant when that participant acquires access to some product provided by that organisation.

        </p>
        <p>For example, this "product-specific" Trusted Issuer List is queried when performing authorization if the related policy rules specify that the issuer of the Verifiable Credential received in the request should have acquired the product that the request is trying to access.

        </p>
        <p>However, as mentioned before, the set of "internal" and "external" Trusted Lists to query is not hardcoded but it depends on the specific policy rules that should be applied to the request when computing the decision to grant access or not.

        </p>
        <p>In this way, the system provides a great deal of flexibility on how access control is performed.

        </p>
        <p>For simplicity, the diagram below shows the query of the Trusted Issuer Lists as a single interaction to a single box, but the actual interactions can be very complex if required. In addition, the diagram does not specify whether the list is "private" or "global".

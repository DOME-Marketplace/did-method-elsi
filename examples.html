    <p>Here we introduce the actors of the reference use case we are going to use. The main actors are marked in yellow in the following diagram.
    </p>
    <p>RealTruth is a Trust Service Provider operating under the eIDAS Trust Framework, which issues a certificate for seals to the company GoodAir. GoodAir is a business that provides some services using an Air Quality application operated by GoodAir.
    </p>
    <p>RealTruth also provides a certificate for signatures to the COO of the GoodAir company, so the COO can use the certificate to sign documents on behalf of GoodAir (like contracts, invoices, financial reports, ...) in a way that is compliant with eIDAS.
    </p>
    <p>The COO of GoodAir will issue a verifiable credential of type LEARCredential to an employee of GoodAir, signing the credential with his certificate for signatures.
    </p>

    <section id='participant'><h2>GoodAir: the company that wants to perform the process</h2>

        <p>The new participant is a business providing an Air Quality Monitoring application as a service. The business is called GoodAir and it operates the application, which receives data from a set of sensors that may or may not be the property of GoodAir. The sensors must have received a certification to be able to operate and send data to the GoodAir application.
        </p>
        <p>The company is registered in the tax agency and business registry of Spain with VAT number <b>VATES-12345678</b>.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id='COO (Chief Operating Officer) of GoodAir'><h2>COO (Chief Operating Officer) of GoodAir</h2>

        <p>The GoodAir company is small and the only person that can sign contracts on behalf of the company is the COO (Chief Operating Officer). The COO is a legal representative of the company and she is registered as so in the business registry of Spain.
        </p>
        <p>The COO has a certificate for electronic signatures issued by one of the TSPs in Spain enabling the COO to perform electronic qualified signatures as legal representative of GoodAir, instead of doing them manually.
        </p>
        <p>The X.509 certificate of the COO has the following contents in the <code>Subject</code> field (the example below is derived from a real certificate but with the identifiers modified to be an example):

                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>The TSP (RealTruth in this case) performs the verifications against <code>Authentic Sources</code>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Authentic Sources are the public or private repositories or systems recognised or required by law containing attributes about a natural or legal persons.
            </p>
            <p>The Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI of the [eIDAS2] legislative proposal are sources for attributes on address, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, education and training qualifications titles and licences, professional qualifications titles and licences, public permits and licences, financial and company data.
            </p>
            <p>Authentic Sources in scope of Annex VI are required to provide interfaces to Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes  (QEAA) Providers to verify the authenticity of the above attributes, either directly or via designated intermediaries recognised at national level.
            </p>
            <p>Authentic Sources may also issue (Q)EAA-s themselves if they meet the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation. It is up to the Member States to define terms and conditions for the provisioning of these services, but according to the minimum technical specifications, standards, and procedures applicable to the verification procedures for qualified electronic attestations of attributes.
            </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In accordance to the policies, RealTruth made those validations when issuing the certificate to the COO, in such a way that the Relying Parties verifying the certificate can have a high level of trust in the assertion that the natural person identified in the certificate (with Spanish ID of 56565656V) is a legal representative of he GoodAir company (organizationIdentifier VATES-12345678).

        <p>This is an employee of the central administration department of GoodAir, who is going to be formally nominated to manage a specific set of processes on behalf of GoodAir in the Data Space. In particular, this employee is going to be nominated as a LEAR (Legal Entity Appointed Representative).
        </p>
        <p>As its name implies, the LEAR has to be nominated by a <b>legal representative</b> of the GoodAir organisation with the necessary legal authority to commit the organisation for this type of decision. In our case, the COO of GoodAir will nominate John Doe as the LEAR of GoodAir, delegating to him the capabilities to perform some processes in the DOME portal and some other tasks in other organisations. That means that John Doe will not be empowered to perform cation snot explicitly specified in the credential.
        </p>
        <p>To perform the nomination, the COO of GoodAir (a legal representative of GoodAir) will issue a special credential to John Doe and will sign the credential with his certificate for signatures as legal representative of GoodAir. The details are described later in this document.
